Compiling Kraut:

You should have the files: kraut.c and kraut.l and lex.yy.c


kraut.l must be run thru the unix 'lex' utility to produce the file lex.yy.c
Then compile kraut.c and lex.yy.c to produce kraut

     $lex kraut.l
     $cc kraut.c lex.yy.c -o kraut
  (You may get a list of warnings from the compiler. Ignore them.)

Note: lex.yy.c is included in this package. You only need to use lex if you
wish to make changes to kraut. 

Using Kraut:

 Kraut uses standard input and output.

examples:

To translate a file called 'note' and output kraut to a file called 'knote':

     $ cat note | kraut > knote

To translate a file called 'note' and just print it to the screen:

     $ cat note | kraut

To have kraut wait to translate what you type at the keyboard and return it in
kraut on your screen:

     $ kraut
