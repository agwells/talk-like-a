CHAPTER 1. Loomings.  Okay?

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—nevuh mind how long precisely—havin' little awh no money in my purse, and nuttin' particular tuh interest me on shawh, I thought I would sail about a little and see de watery part uhv de wawhld. It is a way I have uhv drivin' awhf de spleen and regulatin' de circulashun. Whenevuh I find myself growin' grim about de mouth; whenevuh it is a damp, drizzly Novembuh in my soul; whenevuh I find myself involuntarily pausin' befawh cawhfin warehouses, and bringin' up de rear uhv every funeral I meet; and especially whenevuh my hypos get such an uppuh hand uhv me, dat it requires a strong mawhal principle tuh prevent me from deliberately steppin' into de street, and methodically knockin' people’s hats awhf—den, I account it high time tuh get tuh sea as soon as I can. Dis is my substitute fawh pistol and ball.  Right? Wit' a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his swoid; I quietly take tuh de ship. Dere is nuttin' surprisin' in dis. If dey but knew it, almost all men in deir degree, some time awh udder, cherish very nearly de same feelings towards de ocean wit' me.

Dere now is yuhr insular city uhv de Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by cawhal reefs—commerce surrounds it wit' huh surf.  Yuh got me so fahr? Right and left, de streets take yuh waterward. Its extreme downtown is de battery, where dat noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hawhs previous were out uhv sight uhv land. Look at de crowds uhv water-gazers dere.

Circumambulate de city uhv a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Ya' dig? Go from Cawhlears Hook tuh Coenties Slip, and from dence, by Whitehall, nawhthward. What do yuh see, or what?—Posted like silent sentinels all around de town, stand thousands upon thousands uhv mawhtal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leanin' against de spiles; some seated upon de pier-heads; some lookin' ovuh de bulwarks uhv ships from China; some high aluhvt in de riggin', as if strivin' tuh get a still bettuh seaward peep. But dese are all landsmen; uhv week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied tuh counters, nailed tuh benches, clinched tuh desks.  Yuh with me? How den is dis, or what? Are de green fields gone, or what? What do dey here, or what?

But look!  Okay? here come mawh crowds, pacin' straight fawh de watuh, and seemingly bound fawh a dive. Strange!  Okay? Nuttin' will content dem but de extremest limit uhv de land; loiterin' unner de shady lee uhv yonduh warehouses will not suffice. No. Dey must get just as nigh de watuh as dey possibly can wit'out fallin' in.  Okay? And dere dey stand—miles uhv dem—leagues. Inlanders all, dey come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—nawhth, east, south, and west. Yet here dey all unite. Tell me, does de magnetic virtue uhv de needles uhv de compasses uhv all those ships attract dem dider, or what?

Once mawh. Say yuh are in de country; in some high land uhv lakes.  Right? Take almost any path yuh please, and ten tuh one it carries yuh down in a dale, and leaves yuh dere by a pool in de stream. Dere is magic in it. Let de most absent-minded uhv men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand dat man on his legs, set his feet a-goin', and he will infallibly lead yuh tuh watuh, if watuh dere be in all dat region. Should yuh evuh be atoist in de great American desert, try dis experiment, if yuhr caravan happen tuh be supplied wit' a metaphysical pruhvessawh. Yes, as every one knows, meditashun and watuh are wedded fawh evuh.

But here is an artist.  Yuh got me so fahr? He desires tuh paintcha de dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchantin' bit uhv romantic landscape in all de valley uhv de Saco. What is de chief element he employs, or what? Dere stand his trees, each wit' a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were wit'in; and here sleeps his meadow, and dere sleep his cattle; and up from yonduh cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reachin' tuh overlappin' spurs uhv mountains baded in deir hill-side blue. But though de picture lies thus tranced, and though dis pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon dis shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless de shepherd’s eye were fixed upon de magic stream befawh him.  Ya' dig? Go visit de Prairies in June, when fawh scawhes on scawhes uhv miles yuh wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is de one charm wantin'?—Water—dere is not a drop uhv watuh dere!  Okay? Were Niagara but a cataract uhv sand, would yuh travel yuhr thousand miles tuh see it, or what? Why did de poawh poet uhv Tennessee, upon suddenly receivin' two handfuls uhv silvuh, deliberate wheder tuh buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, awh invest his money in a pedestrian trip tuh Rockaway Beach, or what? Why is almost every robust healthy boy wit' a robust healthy soul in him, at some time awh udder crazy tuh go tuh sea, or what? Why upon yuhr first voyage as a passenguh, d'ja yuhrself feel such a mystical vibrashun, when first told dat yuh and yuhr ship were now out uhv sight uhv land, or what? Why did de old Persians hold de sea holy, or what? Why did de Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brudder uhv Jove, or what? Surely all dis is not wit'out meanin'. And still deepuh de meanin' uhv dat stawhy uhv Narcissus, who becawze he could not grasp de tawhmentin', mild image he saw in de fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But dat same image, we awhselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is de image uhv de ungraspable phantom uhv life; and dis is de key tuh it all.

Now, when I say dat I am in de habit uhv gonna sea whenevuh I begin tuh grow hazy about de eyes, and begin tuh be ovuh conscious uhv my lungs, I do not mean tuh have it inferred dat I evuh go tuh sea as a passenguh. Fawh tuh go as a passenguh yuh must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless yuh have someting in it.  Yuh with me? Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep uhv nights—do not enjoy demselves much, as a general ting;—no, I nevuh go as a passenguh; nawh, though I am someting uhv a salt, do I evuh go tuh sea as a Commodawh, awh a Captain, awh a Cook. I abandon de glawhy and distincshun uhv such awhfices tuh those who like dem. Fawh my part, I abominate all honawhable respectable toils, trials, and tribulashuns uhv every kind whatsoevuh. It is quite as much as I can do tuh take care uhv myself, wit'out takin' care uhv ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as fawh goin' as cook,—though I confess dere is considerable glawhy in dat, a cook bein' a sawht uhv awhficuh on ship-board—yet, somehow, I nevuh fancied broilin' fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, dere is no one who will speak mawh respectfully, not tuh say reverentially, uhv a broiled fowl than I will.  Okay? It is out uhv de idolatrous dotings uhv de old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted rivuh hawhse, dat yuh see de mummies uhv those creatures in deir huge bake-houses de pyramids.

No, when I go tuh sea, I go as a simple sailawh, right befawh de mast, plumb down into de fawhecastle, aluhvt dere tuh de royal mast-head. True, dey radder awhduh me about some, and make me jump from spar tuh spar, like a grasshoppuh in a May meadow. And at first, dis sawht uhv ting is unpleasant enough.  Right? It touches one’s sense uhv honawh, particularly if yuh come uhv an old established family in de land, de Van Rensselaers, awh Randolphs, awh Hardicanutes. And mawh than all, if just previous tuh puttin' yuhr hand into de tar-pot, yuh have been lawhdin' it as a country schoolmastuh, makin' de tallest boys stand in awe uhv yuh. De transishun is a keen one, I assure yuh, from a schoolmastuh tuh a sailawh, and requires a strong decocshun uhv Seneca and de Stoics tuh enable yuh tuh grin and bear it. But even dis wears awhf in time.

What uhv it, if some old hunks uhv a sea-captain awhders me tuh get a broom and sweep down de decks, or what? What does dat indignity amount tuh, weighed, I mean, in de scales uhv de New Testament, or what? Do yuh tink de archangel Gabriel tinks anyting de less uhv me, becawze I promptly and respectfully obey dat old hunks in dat particular instance, or what? Who ain’t a slave, or what? Tell me dat. Well, den, howevuh de old sea-captains may awhduh me about—howevuh dey may thump and punch me about, I have de satisfacshun uhv knowin' dat it is all right; dat everybody else is one way awh udder served in much de same way—eider in a physical awh metaphysical point uhv view, dat is; and so de universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each udder’s shoulder-blades, and be content.  Yuh got me so fahr?

Again, I always go tuh sea as a sailawh, becawze dey make a point uhv payin' me fawh my trouble, whereas dey nevuh pay passengers a single penny dat I evuh hoid uhv. On de contrary, passengers demselves must pay. And dere is all de difference in de wawhld between payin' and bein' paid. De act uhv payin' is perhaps de most uncomfawhtable inflicshun dat de two awhchard dieves entailed upon us. But bein' paid,—what will compare wit' it, or what? De urbane activity wit' which a man receives money is really marvellous, considerin' dat we so earnestly believe money tuh be de root uhv all earthly ills, and dat on no account can a monied man entuh heaven.  Ya' dig? Ah!  Okay? how cheerfully we consign awhselves tuh perdishun!  Okay?

Finally, I always go tuh sea as a sailawh, becawze uhv de wholesome exercise and pure air uhv de fawhe-castle deck. Fawh as in dis wawhld, head winds are far mawh prevalent than winds from astern (dat is, if yuh nevuh violate de Pythagawhean maxim), so fawh de most part de Commodawh on de quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from de sailawhs on de fawhecastle. He tinks he breades it first; but not so. In much de same way do de commonalty lead deir leaders in many udder tings, at de same time dat de leaders little suspect it.  Yuh with me? But wherefawh it was dat aftuh havin' repeatedly smelt de sea as a moichant sailawh, I should now take it into my head tuh go on a whalin' voyage; dis de invisible police awhficuh uhv de Fates, who has de constant surveillance uhv me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can bettuh answuh than any one else. And, doubtless, my goin' on dis whalin' voyage, fawhmed part uhv de grand programme uhv Providence dat was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sawht uhv brief interlude and solo between mawh extensive perfawhmances. I take it dat dis part uhv de bill must have run someting like dis, like, uhh:

“Grand Contested Elecshun fawh de Presidency uhv de United States.  Okay? “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Though I cannot tell why it was exactly dat those stage managers, de Fates, put me down fawh dis shabby part uhv a whalin' voyage, when udders were set down fawh magnificent parts in high tragedies, and shawht and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot tell why dis was exactly; yet, now dat I recall all de circumstances, I tink I can see a little into de springs and motives which bein' cunningly presented tuh me unner various disguises, induced me tuh set about perfawhmin' de part I did, besides cajolin' me into de delusion dat it was a choice resultin' from my own unbiased freewill and discriminatin' judgment.

Chief among dese motives was de overwhelmin' idea uhv de great whale himself. Such a pawhtentous and mysterious monstuh roused all my curiosity. Den de wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; de undeliverable, nameless perils uhv de whale; dese, wit' all de attendin' marvels uhv a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped tuh sway me tuh my wish.  Right? Wit' udder men, perhaps, such tings would not have been inducements; but as fawh me, I am tawhmented wit' an everlastin' itch fawh tings remote. I love tuh sail fawhbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignawhin' what is good, I am quick tuh perceive a hawhrawh, and could still be social wit' it—would dey let me—since it is but well tuh be on friendly terms wit' all de inmates uhv de place one lodges in.

By reason uhv dese tings, den, de whalin' voyage was welcome; de great flood-gates uhv de wonder-wawhld swung open, and in de wild conceits dat swayed me tuh my purpose, two and two dere floated into my inmost soul, endless processions uhv de whale, and, mid most uhv dem all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in de air.  Yuh got me so fahr?
