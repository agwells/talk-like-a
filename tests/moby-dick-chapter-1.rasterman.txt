hcapter 1. loomings...

call em ishmael. some yeasr ago — never midn how log precisely — having little or no mney in ym purse.. and nothing particular to interest me on shore.. i thougthi  would sail about a little and see thew atewry part fo the world. it isa  wayi  have of driving off the splen and reguylating th ecirculation. whenever i fnd myself groiwng grim about the mouth; whenever t is a damp.. driozzl nbovember in ym soul; wheneveri  find myself involuntarilky pausing before coffin warehouss.. adn bringing upthe rear of every funeral i meet; and especially whenevr my hypos ge such an upper hadn of me.. that it requires a strong morla principle to prevent me from deliebrately tsepping into the street.. and methodically knocking ppl’s hats off — then.. i accoun it high time to get to saea as oon as i can. this is my substitute for pistol and ballk. with a philosophical flourish cato throws himselfu pon his sword; i quietly take to the ship. there is nothingh surprising in this. if they but knew it.. almos all men in their dsegree.. some time or other.. cherish very nearly the saem felings toweards the ocean with me...

there nwo is your insular city of the manhattoes.. elted rounbnd byw harves as indian isles by coral reefs — commerec surrounds it with her suyfr. right and leftr.. the streest take u waterwardf. its extreem downtown is the battery.. where that noble mole is washde by waves.. and cooled by breezes.. whicha  few hours previosu were out fo sigt fo land. look at the crowds of water-ghazesr there...

circumambulate the city ofa  dreaym sbabath afternon. go frmo corlears hook to coernmties slip.. and from thence.. by whitehall.. northward. what do u see?  posted like silnet sewntinels all around the town.. stand thousands upon thusands of mortla men fixde ni oecna reveries. some leaning againts teh spils; some seated upno the pier-heads; some oloking over the bulwarks of ships from china; some high lofty in the riugging.. as if striving to get a still bettr seawadr peep. btu these are all landsmen; fo week dys pent up in lat hadn plaster — tied to counters.. naileds to benhes.. clinched ot desks. how thne si this? ar ethe green fields gone? whta do they here?

but look! ere come moer crowds.. pacings traight fo rthe awter.. and seemingly bound fora  dive. strange! nothing will content them but the extremset limit of hte land; loitering undfer the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. no. they muts get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falliung in. and theer theystand — miels of tyhem — leagues. inlandesr all.. thye come from lanes and alleys.. streets and avenues — north.. eastr.. south.. and west. yet here thgey all unite. tell me.. doies the magnetic virtue of the needls of the compassse of all thse ships attract them thither?

once more. say uy are in the country; in some high lanod f lakes. taek almost any path u please.. and ten ot one it carries u down ina  dal.. and leavesu  there by a pool inb the stream. there is magci in it. let them ost absent-mided fo mern e plunged in his deepest reveries — stand that mna on his legs.. et his feet a-going.. and hje will infalliby lead u ot water.. if water there be iu all that region. should u ever be athirt in the grea ameriucan desert.. try htsi experiment.. ify our caravan happen to be supplide with a metaphysical professor. yes.. as every oen knows.. meditation adn water are wedded fore verr...

but here is an artist. he desires to paint u the dreamiest.. shadiest.. quietest.. most enchanting bit of romantic landscasep ni all the valley of the saco. what is the chief element he employs? there standh i strees.. eahc with a hollwo trunk.. as if a hermit and a crucifix weer within; and heer sleeps hi meadow.. and theer sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. depe into distant woodlands winds a mazy way.. reaching ot overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in theri hill-side blue. buttho th picture lies thustranced.. adn tho this pine-tree shakse down its sighs like leaves uipon this shepehrd’s head.. yet all were vain.. unless teh shepherd’s eye were fixde upon the amgic stream befoer him. go visit the prairies in june.. hwnef or scores no scores of miles u waed knee-deep among tiger-lilies — what isthe oen charm awnting? — water — there is not a drop of water there!w ere niagara but a caaract of sand.. wouldu  travel your thousandmiles to see it? why did the poor pote of tennessee.. upon suddenly receiving twohandfusl of silver.. deliberate whether to buy him a coat.. which he sadly nedeed.. ro invest his money in a pedestrian trip to ockaway beach? why is alost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him.. at some time or other crazy togo to sea? why upon yur firs tvoyage as a passenger.. did u yourself feel such a mystical vibration.. when first told that u and your ship were now out of sight of land? why did the old persians hold thesea holy? wyh did te greeks give ti a separate deity..and wn brother of jove? surely all this is not without meaning. and still deepr trhe meaning of that story of narciussus.. who because he could not grasp th tormentiong.. mild image he saw in hte fountain.. plunged inot it and was drowned. btu that sam eimagfe.. we ourselves see in all rivesr and oceasn. it is the imageof th ungrasable phjanto of life; adn this si the key to it all...

now.. when i say thati  amn in teh habit fo going to sea wheneveri  begin to gfrow hazy about the eyes.. and begin to be ovre consciuos of my lungs.. i do nto mean to havei t inferred that iever go to sea as a passenger. for to go as a passenger u must neesd have a purse.. and a purse is but a rag unles u hve somehting in it. besides.. passengersget sea-sikc — growq uarrelsome — don’t sleep of nights — do not enjoy themselvesmuch.. sa a general thing; — no.. i never go as a passenger; nor.. toh i am something of a salt.. do i veer go to sea asa  commodore.. ora  captai.. or a cook. i abnadon the gloray nd distinctio nof usch officse to those who like them. for my part.. i abominate all honorable respectable toils.. trials.. and tribulatinos of every kind whatsoever. it si quite as much as i can do to tak care of myself.. without taking care of shps.. barques.. brigs.. schooners.. and what not. and as for going as cook.. — th oi confess theer is considerable glkory ni that..a  cook being a sort fo officer on shipboard —y et.. somnehow.. i nevre afncied broilingfowls; — tho once broiled.. judiciously buttered.. adn judgmatically salted and peppered..t heer is n one who will speka more respectfully.. not to say rerverentially.. fo a broiled fowl than i will. it is out of the idolatrous dotinsg fo the opld egyptians upon broiled ibis and roastde river horse.. that u see the mummise of those cretures in their huge bake-house he pyramid...

no.. when i go to sea.. i go as a simpole sailor.. right befoer the mas.. plumb down into the foprecastle.. aloft there to the royal mast-hea. true.. they rathre order me about some.. and make em jumpo from sapr to spar.. like a grasshopper i na may meadow. and at first.. thsi sort oif thing is unpleasant enuff. it touches on’s sense of honor.. particulasrly i u come of an old established afmily in the land.. the van rensselaers.. or randolphs.. or hardiacnutes. and ore than all.. if justp revious to putting your hand into the tar-pot.. u have been lordin it as a conutyr schoolmaster.. mkaig the talelstr boys stand in awe fo u. the transitioon isa  keen one.. i assure u.. from a schoolmaster to a saiolr.. and requires a strong decoctino of seneca and the stoic to enable u to rgin and bear it. but even thios easr off in time...

what of it.. if some old hunksfo a se-captain orders me ot get a broom and sweep down the decks? what does thart indignity amouint to.. wieghed.. i mean.. in the scales of the new testament? do u thikn the archangel gabrie thinks anything the less of me.. because i promptyl and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? who ain’t  slave? tel me tat. well.. then.. howeverr the old sea-captains may order me abot — however they may thgump and punch e about..i have teh satisfacvtion fo knowing that it is al lright; that everybody else is one wya or other seved in muhc the same wy — eithre in a physdical or metaphysical point of view.. that is; and so theu nviesral thum si passed round.. and all hands shoiuld rub eahc other’s shuolder-blades.. and be content...

agin.. i always go to sea as a sailor. because they make a point of paying me for my trouble.. hweresa thye never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of. on the ontrary.. passewngers themselkves must pay. and theer si all the difference in the world bnetween paying and being paid. the act of paying is perhasp the most uncomfortablei nfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed uponb us. but beig apid.. — what will compar ewith it? the urbaen ctivitywith which a man recevies money is really marvellous.. considering that we so earnestyl believe money ot be the rooty of all earthyl ills.. and that on no account cna a monied man enter heaven. ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

finally.. i lways go to sea as a sailor.. because of the wholesome exercise and puer air of the fore-castle deck. for a sin this world.. heasd winds are far more prevalentthan winds from astern (that is.. if u never violte the pythagorean mxim).. so for the most part the commodore on the quaretr-deck gets his atmospheer at second hand fromthe sailors on the forecastle. he thinks he breathes i tfirst; but not so. in much the same wya do the commonalty lead their leaders n many other things.. ta the same time that the lkeadesr little suspect it. but wherefore it was tha after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor.. i should now take it into ym head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisiblke police officer of the fates.. who hsa teh constant surveillance of me.. adn secretly dogs me.. and influences me in some unaccontable way — he can bettre answer thna any one else. and.. doubtless.. my going on this whalign voyage.. formed part of the grand programme of providence that was draw up a long time ago. ti came in as as ort fo brief iterlude and sol betweenb moe extensive perforances. i take it thast his part of teh bill must have run somethign likethis:

grand contested election for teh presidency of the nuited states. “whalinmg voyage by one ishmael. “bloopdy battle in affghnistan.”

tho i canont tell why it was exactly thta thoes stage managers.. the fates.. put me down for this shabby part of  whaling voyage.. when othesr were set down for magnificent parts ni high tragedies.. and shotr and easy parts in genteel comedies.. and jolly parts in farces — tho i cnnot tell whty ihs was exactly; yet.. nwo that i recall all the circumstances.. i think i can see a little into the sprinsg asnd motives which being cunningly presneted to me under various disguises.. niduced mne to set about perfoirming the part i did.. ebsides caoling me into the delusion that it was a choice reulting fromp ym own unbisaed ferewill and discriminating judgment...

cief among these motives was the overwehlming idea of teh great whale himself. such a portentous anbd mysterious monster rouse dall my curiosity. then the wild and diostant seas whee he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable.. nameless pewrils of the whale; these.. with all the attenidng marvels ofa  thousand patagonina sights and sounds.. helped to sway me to my wish. with othe rmen.. perhaps.. such things would not have been inducements; but as for me..  am tormented witha neverlasting itch for things remote. i love to sail forbidden seas.. and land on barbarous coatss. nto ignoring what is godo.. i am quick to perceive a horror.. and could still be social with it —would thye let me — since iut si but well to be on friendly terms with lal the imnates of the place on elodges in...

by reason of thees things.. then.. teh whalign voyaeg was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open.. adn in the wild conceits that swayed me to myprupose.. two andtwo there floated intoi my nimos tsoul.. endless processions fo the whale.. and.. mdi omst of them all.. one grand hooded phantom.. like a snwo hill in the air...

i went and got smoe food os we ha bettre ea it. are u tirde of this yet?

the "eleet" filktr specially handles the words erliet and porn.. which should include.. likle eliteness and pornography.. nd un-elite.. and antipornograph...
