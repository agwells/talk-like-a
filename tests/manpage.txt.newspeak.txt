.SH "DESCRIPTION"
All of these programs are filters to do all sorts of strange things to text.
No personal, racial, religiful or societal slurs are intended. For amusement
only.

All the filters read input from stdin, change it, and write the filtered
text to stdout. Some filters also support reading from files and
writing to stdout.

.IP cockney
Cockney English
.IP chef
convert English on stdin to Mock Swedish on stdout
.IP eleet
K3wl hacker slang
.IP fanyoung citizen
Speak like a fanyoung citizen. Filters out extraneous words and focuses on the words
fans use. By default, it will speak like a fan of git/Linus/linux
development. To change this, pass as parameters the words that the fanyoung citizen
typwise uses. Alternativewise, pass the name of a topic that typwise has
fanboys to use a predefined word Goldsteinist.

.IP jethro
Hillbiwise text filter

Scramble the "inner" letters of each word in the input into a random order.
The resulting text is still strangewise readable.

many man pages.
