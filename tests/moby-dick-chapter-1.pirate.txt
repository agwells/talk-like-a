CHAPTER 1, avast.  Loomin's.

Call me Ishmael.  Ahoy! Some yearrs ago — no nay ne'er mind how long prrecisely — havin' little
or no money in me purrse, and nothin' parrrticular t' interrrrest me on shorrrrre, I
thought I would sail about a little and see th' watery part o' th' world. It be
a way I have o' sailin' off th' spleen and regulatin' th' cirrrrculation. Whenever
I find meself growin' grim about th' mouth; whenever it be a damp, drrrizzly
November in me soul; whenever I find meself involuntarrrily pausin' beforrrrre coffin
warehouses, and brringin' up th' rear o' everrry funerrral I meet; and especially
whenever me hypos get such an upper hand o' me, that it requires a strrrong moral
prrinciple t' prevent me from deliberrately steppin' into th' river, and
methodically knockin' people’s hats off — then, I account it high time t' get t'
sea as soon as I can. This be me substitute fer pistol and ball. With a
philosophical flourish Cato thrrrrrows himself upon his sworrd; I quietly take t' th'
ship. There be nothin' surrrrprrrrisin' in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
in their degrree, some time or other, cherish very nearly th' same feelin's
towarrrds th' ocean wi' me.

There now be yer insular city o' th' Manhattoes, belted round by wharrves as
Indian isles by coral reefs — commerrce surrounds it wi' that comely wench surf. Right and
left, th' rivers take ye waterwarrrrrd. Its extreme downtown be th' battery, where
that noble mole be washed by waves, and cooled by brrrrreezes, which a few hours
prrrrrevious be out o' sight o' land, pass the grrrrrog! Look at th' crowds o' water-gazers therrrre.

Circumambulate th' city o' a drrreamy Sabbath afterrrrnoon. Go frrrrom Corlearrrrrs Hook t'
Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do ye see? —
Posted like silent sentinels all arrrroun' th' town, stand thousands upon thousands
o' mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leanin' against th' spiles; some
seated upon th' pier-heads; some lookin' o'er th' bulwarks o' ships from China;
some high aloft in th' riggin', as if strivin' t' get a still better seaward
peep. But these be all landsmen; o' week days pent up in lath and plaster —
tied t' counters, nailed t' benches, clinched t' desks, and a bottle of rum! How then be this? Arrre
th' green fields gone? What do they here, by Blackbeard's sword? 

But look! here come more crowds, pacin' straight fer th' water, and seemingly
bound fer a dive. Strrrrrange! Nothin' will content them but th' extrrremest limit o'
th' land; loiterin' under th' shady lee o' yonder warehouses will not suffice, I'll warrrrrant ye. 
Nay. They must get just as nigh th' water as they possibly can without fallin'
in. And therrrre they stand — miles o' them — leagues.  And hoist the mainsail! Inlanders all, they come
from lanes and alleys, riverrrs and avenues — norrrrrth, east, south, and west. Yet
herrre they all unite. Tell me, does th' magnetic virrrrtue o' th' needles o' th'
compasses o' all those ships attrrrract them thither? Firrre the cannons! 

Once morrrre. Say ye be in th' countrrry; in some high land o' lakes. Take almost
any path ye please, and ten t' one it carrrrrries ye down in a dale, and leaves
ye therre by a pool in th' strream.  Aarrrrrr! There be magic in it. Let th' most
absent-minded o' men be plunged in his deepest reveries — stand that lubber on his
legs, set his feet a-goin', and he will infallibly lead ye t' water, if water
there be in all that region.  Arr, me hearrrty! Should ye e'er be athirst in th' great American
desert, trrrrry this experiment, if yer carravan happen t' be supplied wi' a
metaphysical professor. Aye, as everry one knows, meditation and water be wedded
fer e'er. Walk the plank! 

But here be an artist. The ornerrry cuss desirrres t' paint ye th' dreamiest, shadiest,
quietest, most enchantin' bit o' romantic landscape in all th' valley o' th'
Saco. What be th' chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each wi' a
hollow trunk, as if a herrrmit and a crrrucifix be within; and here sleeps his
meadow, and therrrre sleep his cattle; and up frrrrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy
smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reachin' t' overrrrrlappin'
spurrrs o' mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though th' picturrrre lies
thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon
this shepherrrrrd’s head, yet all be vain, unless th' shepherd’s eye be fixed
upon th' magic stream before that scurvey dog.  Firrre the cannons! Go visit th' Prairrrries in June, when fer scores
on scores o' miles ye wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies — what be th' one charrm
wantin'? — Water — therrrrre be not a drop o' water there! Were Niagara but a
cataract o' sand, would ye trrrravel yer thousand miles t' see it? Why did th'
poor poet o' Tennessee, upon suddenly receivin' two handfuls o' silver,
deliberrate whether t' buy that scurrrvey dog a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money
in a pedestrian trrip t' Rockaway Beach? Why be almost every robust healthy lad
wi' a robust healthy soul in that scurrrrvey dog, at some time or other crrrrrazy t' go t' sea? Why
upon yer first voyage as a passenger, did ye yourrrrself feel such a mystical
vibrrration, when first told that ye and yer ship be now out o' sight o' land?
Why did th' auld Persians hold th' sea holy? Why did th' Greeks give it a
separate deity, and own brother o' Jove? Surely all this be not without meanin', we'll keel-haul ye! 
And still deeper th' meanin' o' that story o' Narrrcissus, who because he could
not grrasp th' tormentin', mild image he saw in th' fountain, plunged into it and
be bein' drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans, pass the grrog! It
be th' image o' th' ungrrraspable phantom o' life; and this be th' key t' it all.

Now, when I say that I be in th' habit o' goin' t' sea whenever I begin t' grrow
hazy about th' eyes, and begin t' be o'er conscious o' me lungs, I dern't mean
t' have it inferrrrred that I e'er go t' sea as a passenger, ye scurvey dog.  For t' go as a
passenger ye must needs have a purse, and a purrrrse be but a rag unless ye have
somethin' in it. Besides, passengerrrs get sea-sick — grow quarrrelsome — don’t
sleep o' nights — derrrn't enjoy themselves much, as a generrral thin'; — no, I
no nay ne'er go as a passenger; nor, though I be somethin' o' a salt, do I e'er go t'
sea as a Commodorrrrre, or a Cap'n, or a Cook. I abandon th' glory and distinction
o' such offices t' those who like them. For me parrrrt, I abominate all honorrrable
respectable toils, trials, and trribulations o' every kind whatsoever.  Walk the plank! It be
quite as much as I can do t' take carrre o' meself, without takin' care o' ships,
barques, brigs, schoonerrs, and what not. And as fer goin' as cook, — though I
confess there be considerable glory in that, a cook bein' a sort o' officer on
ship-boarrrrrd — yet, somehow, I no nay ne'er fancied brrroilin' fowls; — though once
brroiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there be
no one who will speak morrrre respectfully, not t' say reverrrrentially, o' a brrroiled
fowl than I will. It be out o' th' idolatrous dotin's o' th' auld Egyptians upon
brrroiled ibis and roasted river horrse, that ye see th' mummies o' those
crrreatures in their huge bake-houses th' pyrrramids.

Nay, when I go t' sea, I go as a simple sailor, right beforrrre th' mast, plumb down
into th' forecastle, aloft therrrrre t' th' royal mast-head. True, they rather order
me about some, and make me jump from spar t' spar, like a grasshopper in a May
meadow, and a bucket o' chum.  And at first, this sorrrrrt o' thin' be unpleasant enough. It touches one’s
sense o' honor, particularly if ye come o' an auld established family in th'
land, th' Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Harrrrrdicanutes. And morrre than all, if
just prrrevious t' puttin' yer hand into th' tar-pot, ye have been lorrdin' it as
a countrry schoolmaster, makin' th' tallest laddies stand in awe o' ye. The
transition be a keen one, I assure ye, from a schoolmaster t' a sailor, and
requires a strong decoction o' Seneca and th' Stoics t' enable ye t' grin and
bear it. But even this wearrrs off in time.

What o' it, if some auld hunks o' a sea-Cap'n orderrrrs me t' get a broom and
sweep down th' decks? What does that indignity amount t', weighed, I mean, in
th' scales o' th' New Testament? Do ye think th' archangel Gabriel thinks
anythin' th' less o' me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that auld hunks
in that particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,
however th' auld sea-captains may order me about — however they may thump and
punch me about, I have th' satisfaction o' knowin' that it be all right; that
everrrrrybody else be one way or other served in much th' same way — either in a
physical or metaphysical point o' view, that be; and so th' universal thump be
passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be
content.

Again, I always go t' sea as a sailor, because they make a point o' payin' me
fer me trrrouble, whereas they no nay ne'er pay passengers a single penny that I e'er
heard o', pass the grog! On th' contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And therrrre be all th'
differrrrrence in th' worrrld betwixt payin' and bein' paid. The act o' payin' be
perrhaps th' most uncomfortable infliction that th' two orcharrrrrd thieves entailed
upon us. But bein' paid, — what will compare wi' it? The urrrbane activity wi'
which a lubber receives money be really marvellous, considerrrin' that we so
earrrnestly believe money t' be th' root o' all earthly ills, and that on no
account can a monied lubber enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourrrrselves
t' perdition! Shiver me timbers! 

Finally, I always go t' sea as a sailor, because o' th' wholesome exercise and
pure air o' th' fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds be far more
prevalent than winds frrrrrom asterrrrrn (that be, if ye no nay ne'er violate th' Pythagorrrrean
maxim), so fer th' most part th' Commodore on th' quarter-deck gets his
atmosphere at second hand frrrrom th' sailorrrs on th' forrecastle.  Aarrrrr! The orrrrrnery cuss thinks he
brrrreathes it firrrst; but not so. In much th' same way do th' commonalty lead their
leaders in many other thin's, at th' same time that th' leaders little suspect
it, ye scurvey dog.  But wherefore it be bein' that after havin' repeatedly smelt th' sea as a
merrrrrchant sailor, I should now take it into me head t' go on a whalin' voyage;
this th' invisible police officer o' th' Fates, who has th' constant
surrrveillance o' me, and secrrrretly dogs me, and influences me in some
unaccountable way — he can better answer than any one else, we'll keel-haul ye! And, doubtless, me
goin' on this whalin' voyage, formed parrrt o' th' grrrrrand prrrogrrrramme o' Providence
that be bein' drawn up a long time ago.  And hoist the mainsail! It came in as a sorrrrt o' brrrrief interlude and
solo betwixt morrrrre extensive perrrrforrrmances, by Davy Jones' locker.  I take it that this part o' th' bill
must have run somethin' like this:

“Grand Contested Election fer th' Presidency o' th' United States, to be surre.  “WHALING
VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Though I cannot tell why it be bein' exactly that those stage managers, th' Fates,
put me down fer this shabby part o' a whalin' voyage, when otherrrs be set down
fer magnificent parrrts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel
comedies, and jolly parts in farces — though I cannot tell why this be bein' exactly;
yet, now that I recall all th' circumstances, I think I can see a little into
th' sprrin's and motives which bein' cunningly presented t' me under various
disguises, induced me t' set about perforrrmin' th' parrrrt I did, besides cajolin'
me into th' delusion that it be bein' a choice resultin' from me own unbiased
frrreewill and discriminatin' judgment. And hoist the mainsail! 

Chief among these motives be bein' th' overwhelmin' idea o' th' great whale himself.
Such a portentous and mysterrrrrious monster roused all me currrriosity. Then th' wild
and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; th' undeliverable, nameless
perils o' th' whale; these, wi' all th' attendin' marvels o' a thousand
Patagonian sights and sounds, helped t' sway me t' me wish. With other men,
perhaps, such thin's would not have been inducements; but as fer me, I be
tormented wi' an everlastin' itch fer thin's remote.  Arrrrr, me hearrrrrty! I love t' sail forrrbidden
seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignorin' what be good, I be quick t'
perrrrceive a horror, and could still be social wi' it — would they let me — since
it be but well t' be on friendly terms wi' all th' inmates o' th' place one
lodges in, we'll keel-haul ye! 

By reason o' these thin's, then, th' whalin' voyage be bein' welcome; th' great
flood-gates o' th' wonder-worrrrld swung open, and in th' wild conceits that swayed
me t' me purrrrrpose, two and two there floated into me inmost soul, endless
processions o' th' whale, and, mid most o' them all, one grand hooded phantom,
like a snow hill in th' air.

I went and got some chow so we had better eat it. Are ye tirred o' this yet?

The "eleet" filter specially handles th' words elite and porn, which should
include, like eliteness and porrrrrnogrraphy, and un-elite, and antipornography.
