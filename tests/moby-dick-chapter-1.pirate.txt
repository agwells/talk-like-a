CHAPTER 1, avast.  Loomin's.

Call me Ishmael.  Ahoy! Some yearrrrs ago — no nay ne'er mind how long prrrrrecisely — havin' little or no money in me purse, and nothin' particular t' interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see th' waterrry part o' th' world. It be a way I have o' sailin' off th' spleen and regulatin' th' circulation. Whenever I find meself grrrowin' grrrim about th' mouth; whenever it be a damp, drrrrrizzly November in me soul; whenever I find meself involuntarily pausin' beforre coffin warrrehouses, and brrringin' up th' rear o' every funerrral I meet; and especially whenever me hypos get such an upper hand o' me, that it requires a strrong moral principle t' prrevent me frrrrrom deliberately steppin' into th' river, and methodically knockin' people’s hats off — then, I account it high time t' get t' sea as soon as I can. This be me substitute fer pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourrrrrish Cato thrrows himself upon his sworrrrrd; I quietly take t' th' ship. There be nothin' surrrrprrrrisin' in this, and a bottle of rum! If they but knew it, almost all men in their degrree, some time or other, cherish very nearly th' same feelin's towards th' ocean wi' me.

There now be yer insular city o' th' Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by corral reefs — commerce surrounds it wi' that comely wench surrrrf. Right and left, th' rivers take ye waterwarrrrrd. Its extreme downtown be th' battery, where that noble mole be washed by waves, and cooled by brrrrreezes, which a few hours previous be out o' sight o' land. Look at th' crrrrrowds o' water-gazerrrrrs therrrrre.

Circumambulate th' city o' a drrrreamy Sabbath afternoon.  And swab the deck! Go frrrrrom Corlears Hook t' Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northwarrrrd. What do ye see? — Posted like silent sentinels all aroun' th' town, stand thousands upon thousands o' mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.  And swab the deck! Some leanin' against th' spiles; some seated upon th' pier-heads; some lookin' o'er th' bulwarks o' ships from China; some high aloft in th' riggin', as if strivin' t' get a still better seaward peep. But these be all landsmen; o' week days pent up in lath and plaster — tied t' counters, nailed t' benches, clinched t' desks, and a bottle of rum! How then be this? Are th' green fields gone? What do they here? And swab the deck! 

But look! here come morre crowds, pacin' strrraight fer th' water, and seemingly bound fer a dive.  And hoist the mainsail! Strrrange! Nothin' will content them but th' extremest limit o' th' land; loiterin' under th' shady lee o' yonder warehouses will not suffice, by Blackbearrrrd's sword.  Nay.  Aarrrrrrr! They must get just as nigh th' water as they possibly can without fallin' in. And therrrre they stand — miles o' them — leagues. Inlanders all, they come frrom lanes and alleys, riverrrs and avenues — norrrrrth, east, south, and west. Yet herrre they all unite, ye scurrrrvey dog.  Tell me, does th' magnetic virtue o' th' needles o' th' compasses o' all those ships attrrrrract them thither?

Once morrre. Say ye be in th' countrrrrry; in some high land o' lakes.  Fire the cannons! Take almost any path ye please, and ten t' one it carrrrrries ye down in a dale, and leaves ye therre by a pool in th' strream. Therrrre be magic in it. Let th' most absent-minded o' men be plunged in his deepest reveries — stand that lubber on his legs, set his feet a-goin', and he will infallibly lead ye t' water, if water there be in all that region. Should ye e'er be athirst in th' grrreat American desert, trrry this experiment, if yer caravan happen t' be supplied wi' a metaphysical professor. Aye, as every one knows, meditation and water be wedded fer e'er.

But here be an artist. The ornerrry cuss desirrres t' paint ye th' dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchantin' bit o' romantic landscape in all th' valley o' th' Saco. What be th' chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each wi' a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crrrucifix be within; and herrre sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up frrrrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reachin' t' overrrrlappin' spurs o' mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though th' picturre lies thus trrranced, and though this pine-trrrree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all be vain, unless th' shepherd’s eye be fixed upon th' magic strrrrream before that scurrvey dog, and a bucket o' chum.  Go visit th' Prairies in June, when fer scores on scorrres o' miles ye wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies — what be th' one charm wantin'? — Water — therrrre be not a drop o' water there! Werre Niagarrrrra but a cataract o' sand, would ye travel yer thousand miles t' see it? Why did th' poor poet o' Tennessee, upon suddenly receivin' two handfuls o' silver, deliberate whether t' buy that scurvey dog a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trrrrip t' Rockaway Beach? Why be almost everry robust healthy lad wi' a robust healthy soul in that scurrrvey dog, at some time or other crazy t' go t' sea? Why upon yer firrst voyage as a passenger, did ye yourself feel such a mystical vibrrrration, when firrrrrst told that ye and yer ship be now out o' sight o' land? Why did th' auld Persians hold th' sea holy? Why did th' Grrrreeks give it a separate deity, and own brrrother o' Jove? Surely all this be not without meanin'. And still deeper th' meanin' o' that story o' Narcissus, who because he could not grasp th' tormentin', mild image he saw in th' fountain, plunged into it and be bein' drowned, and a bucket o' chum.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.  Walk the plank! It be th' image o' th' ungraspable phantom o' life; and this be th' key t' it all.

Now, when I say that I be in th' habit o' goin' t' sea whenever I begin t' grow hazy about th' eyes, and begin t' be o'er conscious o' me lungs, I dern't mean t' have it inferrrrred that I e'er go t' sea as a passenger.  Walk the plank! For t' go as a passenger ye must needs have a purse, and a purse be but a rag unless ye have somethin' in it. Besides, passengerrrrs get sea-sick — grow quarrelsome — don’t sleep o' nights — dern't enjoy themselves much, as a generrrral thin'; — no, I no nay ne'er go as a passenger; nor, though I be somethin' o' a salt, do I e'er go t' sea as a Commodore, or a Cap'n, or a Cook. I abandon th' glorrry and distinction o' such offices t' those who like them.  And hoist the mainsail! For me part, I abominate all honorrable respectable toils, trials, and trrribulations o' everrry kind whatsoever, pass the grog! It be quite as much as I can do t' take carrrrre o' meself, without takin' care o' ships, barques, brrrrigs, schoonerrrs, and what not. And as fer goin' as cook, — though I confess there be considerable glory in that, a cook bein' a sorrt o' officer on ship-board — yet, somehow, I no nay ne'er fancied brrroilin' fowls; — though once broiled, judiciously butterrrred, and judgmatically salted and peppered, therre be no one who will speak more respectfully, not t' say reverentially, o' a broiled fowl than I will. It be out o' th' idolatrous dotin's o' th' auld Egyptians upon brrrrroiled ibis and roasted river horrrse, that ye see th' mummies o' those crreatures in their huge bake-houses th' pyramids, with a chest full of booty. 

Nay, when I go t' sea, I go as a simple sailor, right beforre th' mast, plumb down into th' forrrrrecastle, aloft therrrrre t' th' royal mast-head.  Shiver me timbers! Trrrue, they rather orrrrder me about some, and make me jump frrrrom spar t' spar, like a grrrrrasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort o' thin' be unpleasant enough.  Arr, me hearty! It touches one’s sense o' honor, particularrrrrly if ye come o' an auld established family in th' land, th' Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Harrrrrdicanutes.  And swab the deck! And more than all, if just previous t' puttin' yer hand into th' tar-pot, ye have been lorrdin' it as a countrrrrry schoolmaster, makin' th' tallest laddies stand in awe o' ye. The trrransition be a keen one, I assurrre ye, frrom a schoolmaster t' a sailor, and requires a strrong decoction o' Seneca and th' Stoics t' enable ye t' grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time, avast. 

What o' it, if some auld hunks o' a sea-Cap'n orderrs me t' get a brrroom and sweep down th' decks? What does that indignity amount t', weighed, I mean, in th' scales o' th' New Testament? Do ye think th' archangel Gabrrrriel thinks anythin' th' less o' me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that auld hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that, pass the grog! Well, then, however th' auld sea-captains may order me about — however they may thump and punch me about, I have th' satisfaction o' knowin' that it be all right; that everybody else be one way or other served in much th' same way — either in a physical or metaphysical point o' view, that be; and so th' universal thump be passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.

Again, I always go t' sea as a sailor, because they make a point o' payin' me fer me trouble, whereas they no nay ne'er pay passengers a single penny that I e'er heard o'. On th' contrrarry, passengers themselves must pay.  Ahoy! And there be all th' difference in th' worrrrld betwixt payin' and bein' paid. The act o' payin' be perrrrhaps th' most uncomfortable infliction that th' two orcharrd thieves entailed upon us. But bein' paid, — what will compare wi' it? The urbane activity wi' which a lubber receives money be really marrrrrvellous, considerrrrin' that we so earnestly believe money t' be th' root o' all earrrthly ills, and that on no account can a monied lubber enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourrrselves t' perrrdition!

Finally, I always go t' sea as a sailor, because o' th' wholesome exercise and pure air o' th' fore-castle deck.  And hoist the mainsail! For as in this world, head winds be far more prevalent than winds from asterrrrrn (that be, if ye no nay ne'er violate th' Pythagorrrrrean maxim), so fer th' most parrrrt th' Commodore on th' quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from th' sailors on th' forecastle. The orrrrnerrry cuss thinks he brreathes it firrrst; but not so. In much th' same way do th' commonalty lead their leaders in many other thin's, at th' same time that th' leaderrrrrs little suspect it. But wherefore it be bein' that after havin' repeatedly smelt th' sea as a merrrrchant sailor, I should now take it into me head t' go on a whalin' voyage; this th' invisible police officer o' th' Fates, who has th' constant surrrveillance o' me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way — he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, me goin' on this whalin' voyage, formed part o' th' grrand programme o' Prrrrrovidence that be bein' drrrawn up a long time ago.  Shiver me timberrrrs! It came in as a sort o' brief interlude and solo betwixt morrre extensive perrrrrforrrmances.  And hoist the mainsail! I take it that this parrrrt o' th' bill must have run somethin' like this:

“Grand Contested Election fer th' Prrrresidency o' th' United States, by Davy Jones' locker.  “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.  And hoist the mainsail! “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Though I cannot tell why it be bein' exactly that those stage managers, th' Fates, put me down fer this shabby part o' a whalin' voyage, when others be set down fer magnificent parts in high trrrrragedies, and shorrrrt and easy parrrts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces — though I cannot tell why this be bein' exactly; yet, now that I recall all th' circumstances, I think I can see a little into th' sprin's and motives which bein' cunningly prresented t' me under varrrious disguises, induced me t' set about perforrrmin' th' parrrt I did, besides cajolin' me into th' delusion that it be bein' a choice resultin' from me own unbiased freewill and discriminatin' judgment.

Chief among these motives be bein' th' overwhelmin' idea o' th' grrrreat whale himself, avast.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all me currriosity. Then th' wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; th' undeliverable, nameless perils o' th' whale; these, wi' all th' attendin' marvels o' a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped t' sway me t' me wish, by Davy Jones' locker.  With other men, perhaps, such thin's would not have been inducements; but as fer me, I be tormented wi' an everlastin' itch fer thin's remote, I'll warrrrrrrrrant ye.  I love t' sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts, I'll warrant ye.  Not ignorin' what be good, I be quick t' perceive a horror, and could still be social wi' it — would they let me — since it be but well t' be on friendly terrrrms wi' all th' inmates o' th' place one lodges in.

By reason o' these thin's, then, th' whalin' voyage be bein' welcome; th' grrrreat flood-gates o' th' wonder-worrld swung open, and in th' wild conceits that swayed me t' me purpose, two and two there floated into me inmost soul, endless processions o' th' whale, and, mid most o' them all, one grrrrand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in th' air.

I went and got some chow so we had better eat it. Are ye tired o' this yet?

The "eleet" filter specially handles th' words elite and porrrrn, which should include, like eliteness and porrrrrnography, and un-elite, and antipornography, we'll keel-haul ye!
