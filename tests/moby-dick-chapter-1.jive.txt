CHAPTER 1. Loomin's.  What it is, Mama!

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago — nevuh mind how long precisely — havin' little o' no bre'd in mah' purse, an' nodin' particular t'interest me on sho'e, ah' dought ah' would sail about some little an' see's de watery part uh de wo'ld. It is some way ah' gots' uh drivin' off de spleen an' regulatin' de circulashun. Whenevuh ah' find mah'self growin' grim about da damn moud; whenevuh it is some damp, drizzly Novembuh in mah' soul; whenevuh ah' find mah'self involuntarily pausin' befo'e coffin warehouses, an' brin'in' up de rear uh every funeral ah' meet; an' especially whenevuh mah' hypos git such an uppuh' han' uh me, dat it requires some strong mo'al principle t'prevent me fum deliberately steppin' into de street, an' medodic'l knockin' sucka's’s hats off — den, ah' account it high time t'git t'sea as soon as ah' kin. Dis is mah' subs'itoot fo' pistol an' ball. Wid some philosophical flourish Cato t'rows himself upon his swo'd; ah' quietly snatch t'de ship.  Ya' know? Dere ain'thin' surprisin' in dis. If dey but knowed it, mos' all dudes in deir degree, some time o' uthu', cherish real nearly de same feelin's towards de ocean wif me.

Dere now is yo' insular city uh de Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by co'al reefs — commerce surrounds it wif huh surf. Right an' left, de streets snatch ya' waterward.  Sheeeiit. Its 'estreme downtown is de battery, where dat noble mole is washed by waves, an' cooled by breezes, whut some few hours previous wuz out uh sight uh lan'. Look at da damn crowds uh water-gazers dere.

Circumambulate da damn city uh some dreamy Sabbad afternoon. Go fum Co'lears Hook t'Coenties Slip, an' fum dence, by Whitehall, no'dward. What do ya' see's? — Posted likes sah'lnt sentinels all around da damn town, stan' dousan's upon dousan's uh mo'tal dudes fixed in ocean reveries.  Ya' dig? Some leanin' agin' de spah'ls; some seated upon de pier-'haids; some lookin' ovuh de bulwarks uh ships fum China; some high aloft in de riggin', as if strivin' t'git some still bettuh seaward peep. But dese is all lan'smen; uh week days pent up in lad an' plastuh — tied t'counters, naah'ld t'benches, clinched t'desks. How den is dis? Are da damn green fields gone? What do dey here?

But look.  Right On! here mosey on down mo'e crowds, pacin' straight fo' de watuh, an' seemin'ly bound fo' some dive. Strange.  Right On! Nodin' gots'ta content dem but da damn 'estremest limit uh de lan'; loiterin' unduh de shady lee uh yonduh warehouses gots'ta not suffice.  Git down! No. Dey must git plum as nigh de watuh as dey possibly kin wifout fallin' in. An' dere dey stan' — mah'ls uh dem — leagues. Inlan'ers all, dey mosey on down fum lanes an' alleys, streets an' avenues — no'd, east, soud, an' west.  What it is, Mama! Yet here dey all unite. Tell me, duz de magnetic virtue uh de needles uh de compasses uh all dose ships attrac' dem diduh?

Once mo'e. Say ya' is in de country; in some high lan' uh lakes. Take mos' any alley ya' please, an' ten t'one it carries ya' down in some dale, an' leaves ya' dere by some pool in de stream.  Ya' know? Dere is magic in it. Let da damn most absent-minded uh dudes be plunged in his deepest reveries — stan' dat dude on his legs, set his feet a-goin', an' mah' man he gots'ta infallibly lead ya' t'watuh, if watuh dere be in all dat region. Should ya' evuh be adirst in de great American desert, try dis 'espuh'iment, if yo' caravan happen t'be supplied wif some meta-fuckin'physical professo'. Yes, as every one knows, meditashun an' watuh is wedded fo' evuh.

But here is an artist. He desires t'paint ya' de dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchantin' bit uh romantic lan'scape in all de valley uh de Saco.  Sheeeiit. What is de chief element mah' man he employs? Dere stan' his trees, each wif some hollow trunk, as if some hermit an' some crucifix wuz wifin; an' here sleeps his meadow, an' dere sleep his cattle; an' up fum yonduh cottage goes some sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlan's winds some mazy way, reachin' t'overlappin' spurs uh mountains baded in deir hill-side blue. But dough de picture honky jives dus tranced, an' dough dis pine-tree shakes down its sighs likes leaves upon dis shepherd’s 'haid, yet all wuz vain, unless de shepherd’s eye wuz fixed upon de magic stream befo'e him. Go visit da damn Prairies in June, when fo' sco'es on sco'es uh mah'ls ya' wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies — whut is de one charm wants'in'? — Watuh — dere ain't some drop uh watuh dere.  Right On! Were Niagara but some catarac' uh san', would ya' travel yo' dousan' mah'ls t'see it? Why dun did de poo' poet uh Tennessee, upon suddenly receivin' two han'fuls uh silvuh, deliberate wheduh t'steal him some coat, whut mah' man he sadly needed, o' invest his bre'd in some pedestrian trip t'Rockaway Beach? Why is mos' every robust healdy boy wif some robust healdy soul in him, at some time o' uthu' crazy t'go t'sea? Why upon yo' fust voyage as some passenguh, dun did ya' yo'self feel such some mah'stical vibrashun, when fust told dat ya' an' yo' ship wuz now out uh sight uh lan'? Why dun did de old Persians hold da damn sea holy? Why dun did de Greeks give it some separate deity, an' own bruthu' uh Jove? Sho'ly all dis ain't wifout meanin'. An' still deepuh' de meanin' uh dat sto'y uh Narcissus, who 'cuz mah' man he could not grasp de to'mentin', mild image mah' man he saw in de fountain, plunged into it an' wuz drowned.  Ya' dig? But dat same image, we ourselves see's in all rivers an' oceans. It is de image uh de ungraspable phantom uh life; an' dis is de key t'it all.

Now, when ah' say dat ah' am in de habit uh goin' t'sea whenevuh ah' begin t'grow hazy about da damn eyes, an' begin t'be ovuh conscious uh mah' lungs, ah' do not mean t'gots' it inferred dat ah' evuh mosey on down t'sea as some passenguh. Fo' t'go as some passenguh ya' must needs gots' some purse, an' some purse is but some rag unless ya' gots' sump'n in it. Besides, passengers git sea-sick — grow quarrelsome — don’t sleep uh nights — do not enjoy demselves much, as some general thang; — no, ah' nevuh mosey on down as some passenguh; no', dough ah' am sump'n uh some salt, do ah' evuh mosey on down t'sea as some Commodo'e, o' some Captain, o' some Cook.  Git down! ah' aban'on de glo'y an' dis'incshun uh such offices t'dose who likes dem. Fo' mah' part, ah' abominate all hono'able respectable toils, trials, an' tribulashuns uh every kind whutsoevuh. It is quite as much as ah' kin do t'take care uh mah'self, wifout takin' care uh ships, barques, brigs, schooners, an' whut not. An' as fo' goin' as cook, — dough ah' confess dere is considerable glo'y in dat, some cook bein' some so't uh officuh on ship-bo'd — yet, somehow, ah' nevuh fancied broilin' fowls; — dough once broah'ld, judiciously buttered, an' judgmatic'l salted an' peppuh'ed, dere is no one who gots'ta speak mo'e respectfully, not t'say reverentially, uh some broah'ld fowl dan ah' gots'ta. It is out uh de idolatrous dotin's uh de old Egyptians upon broah'ld ibis an' roasted rivuh ho'se, dat ya' see's de mummies uh dose creatures in deir huge bake-houses de pyramids.

No, when ah' mosey on down t'sea, ah' mosey on down as some simple sailo', right befo'e da damn mast, plumb down into de fo'ecastle, aloft dere t'de royal mast-'haid. True, dey raduh o'duh me about some, an' make me jump fum spar t'spar, likes some grasshoppuh' in some May meadow.  What it is, Mama! An' at fust, dis so't uh doohickey is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense uh hono', particularly if ya' mosey on down uh an old established family in de lan', de Van Rensselaers, o' Ran'olphs, o' Hardicanutes. An' mo'e dan all, if plum previous t'puttin' yo' han' into de tar-pot, ya' gots' been lo'din' it as some country schoolmastuh, makin' de tallest boys stan' in awe uh ya'. De transishun is some keen one, ah' assho' ya', fum some schoolmastuh t'a sailo', an' requires some strong decocshun uh Seneca an' de Stoics t'enable ya' t'grin an' bear it. But even dis wears off in time.  Ya' know?

What uh it, if some old hunks uh some sea-captain o'ders me t'git some broom an' sweep down de decks? What duz dat indignity amount t', weighed, ah' mean, in de scales uh de New Testament? Do ya' thin' de archangel Gabriel dinks anydin' de less uh me, 'cuz ah' promptly an' respectfully obey dat old hunks in dat particular instance? Who ain’t some slave? Tell me dat. Well, den, howevuh de old sea-captains may o'duh me about — howevuh dey may dump an' punch me about, ah' gots' de satisfacshun uh knowin' dat it is all right; dat everybody else is one way o' uthu' served in much de same way — eiduh in some physical o' meta-fuckin'physical point uh view, dat is; an' so's de universal dump is passed round, an' all han's should rub each uthu'’s shoulder-blades, an' be content.

Again, ah' always mosey on down t'sea as some sailo', 'cuz dey make some point uh payin' me fo' mah' trouble, whereas dey nevuh pay passengers some sin'le penny dat ah' evuh 'hoid uh. On de contrary, passengers demselves must pay. An' dere is all de difference in de wo'ld between payin' an' bein' paid.  Sheeeiit. De ac' uh payin' is puh'haps de most uncomfo'table inflicshun dat da damn two o'chard dieves entaah'ld upon us. But bein' paid, — whut gots'ta compare wif it? De urbane activity wif whut some dude receives bre'd is really marvellous, considerin' dat we so's earnestly recon' bre'd t'be da damn root uh all eardly ills, an' dat on no account kin some monied dude entuh heaven. Ah.  Right On! how cheerfully we consign ourselves t'puh'dishun.  Right On!

Finally, ah' always mosey on down t'sea as some sailo', 'cuz uh de wholesome 'esercise an' pure air uh de fo'e-castle deck. Fo' as in dis wo'ld, 'haid winds is far mo'e prevalent dan winds fum astern (dat is, if ya' nevuh violate da damn Pydago'ean maxim), so's fo' de most part da damn Commodo'e on de quarter-deck gits his atmosphere at second han' fum de sailo's on de fo'ecastle.  Ya' dig? He dinks mah' man he breades it fust; but not so's. In much de same way do de commonalty lead deir leaders in many uthu' thangs, at da damn same time dat da damn leaders little suspec' it. But wherefo'e it wuz dat aftuh havin' repeatedly smelt da damn sea as some merchant sailo', ah' should now snatch it into mah' 'haid t'go on some whalin' voyage; dis de invisible honky pigs officuh uh de Fates, who gots'ta de constant surveillance uh me, an' secretly dogs me, an' influences me in some unaccountable way — mah' man he kin bettuh answuh dan any one else. An', doubtless, mah' goin' on dis whalin' voyage, fo'med part uh de gran' honky codee uh Providence dat wuz drawn up some long time ago. It came in as some so't uh brief interlude an' solo between mo'e 'estensive puh'fo'mances.  Git down! ah' snatch it dat dis part uh de bill must gots' run sump'n likes dis, dig dis:

“Gran' Contested Elecshun fo' de Presidency uh de United States. “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Dough ah' kinnot tell why it wuz 'esactly dat dose stage managers, de Fates, put me down fo' dis shabby part uh some whalin' voyage, when uthu's wuz set down fo' magnificent parts in high tragedies, an' sho't an' easy parts in genteel comedies, an' jolly parts in farces — dough ah' kinnot tell why dis wuz 'esactly; yet, now dat ah' recall all de circumstances, ah' thin' ah' kin see's some little into de sprin's an' motives whut bein' cunnin'ly presented t'me unduh various disguises, induced me t'set about puh'fo'min' de part ah' dun did, besides cajolin' me into de delusion dat it wuz some choice resultin' fum mah' own unbiased freegots'ta an' discriminatin' judgment.

Chief among dese motives wuz de overwhelmin' idea uh de great whale himself. Such some po'tentous an' mah'sterious monstuh roused all mah' curiosity.  What it is, Mama! Den de wild an' distant seas where mah' man he rolled his islan' bulk; de undeliverable, dojiggerless puh'ils uh de whale; dese, wif all de attendin' marvels uh some dousan' Patagonian sights an' sounds, helped t'sway me t'my wish. Wid uthu' dudes, puh'haps, such wahtahmelluns would not gots' been inducements; but as fo' me, ah' am to'mented wif an everlas'ing itch fo' thangs remote. ah' love t'sail fo'bidden seas, an' lan' on barbarous coasts. Not igno'in' whut is baaaad, ah' am quick t'puh'ceive some ho'ro', an' could still be social wif it — would dey let me — since it is but well t'be on friendly terms wif all de inmates uh de place one lodges in.  Ya' know?

By reason uh dese doohickeys, den, de whalin' voyage wuz welcome; de great flood-gates uh de wonder-wo'ld swung jimmey, an' in de wild conceits dat swayed me t'my purpose, two an' two dere floated into mah' inmost soul, endless processions uh de whale, an', mid most uh dem all, one gran' hooded phantom, likes some snow hill in de air.

I went an' gots some catfish an' colluhd greens so's we had bettuh feed da bud it. Are ya' tired uh dis yet?

De "eleet" filtuh specially han'les de wo'ds elite an' po'n, whut should include, likes eliteness an' po'nography, an' un-elite, an' antipo'nography.
