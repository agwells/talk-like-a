CHAPTR 1. LOOMINGS.

CALL ME ISHMAEL. SOME YEARS AGO — NEVR MIND HOW LONG PRECIZELY — HAVIN LITTLE OR NO MONEY IN MY PURZE, AND NOTHIN PARTICULAR 2 INTEREZT ME ON SHORE, I THOUGHT I WOULD SAIL ABOUT LITTLE AND ZEE THE WATERY PART OF THE WORLD. IT IS WAY I HAS OF DRIVIN OFF THE SPLEEN AND REGULATIN THE CIRCULASHUN. WHENEVR I FIND MYZELF GROWIN GRIM ABOUT THE MOUTH; WHENEVR IT IS DAMP, DRIZZLY NOVEMBR IN MY SOUL; WHENEVR I FIND MYZELF INVOLUNTARILY PAUSIN BEFORE COFFIN WAREHOUZEZ, AND BRINGIN UP THE REAR OF EVRY FUNERAL I MEET; AND EZPECIALLY WHENEVR MY HYPOS GET SUCH AN UPPR HAND OF ME, THAT IT REQUIREZ STRONG MORAL PRINCIPLE 2 PREVENT ME FROM DELIBERATELY STEPPIN INTO THE STREET, AND METHODICALLY KNOKIN PEOPLE’S HATS OFF — THEN, I ACSOUNT IT HIGH TIME 2 GET 2 ZEA AS SOON AS I CAN. THIS IS MY SUBSTITUTE 4 PISTOL AND BALL. WITH FILOSOFICAL FLOURISH KATO THROWS HIMZELF UPON HIS SWORD; I QUIETLY TAEK 2 THE SHIP. THERE IS NOTHIN SURPRISIN IN THIS. IF THEY BUT KNEW IT, ALMOST ALL MEN IN THEIR DEGREE, SOME TIME OR OTHR, CHERISH VERY NEARLY THE SAME FEELINGS TOWARDZ THE OCEAN WITH ME.

THERE NOW IS YOUR INZULAR CITY OF THE MANHATTOEZ, BELTD ROUND BY WHARVEZ AS INDIAN ISLEZ BY CORAL REEFS — COMMERCE SURROUNDZ IT WITH HR SURF. RITE AND LEFT, THE STREETS TAEK YOU WATERWARD. ITS EXTREME DOWNTOWN IS THE BATTERY, WHERE THAT NOBLE MOLE IS WASHD BY WAVEZ, AND COOLD BY BREEZEZ, WHICH FEW HOURS PREVIOUS WERE OUT OF SITE OF LAND. LOOK AT THE CROWDZ OF WATR-GAZERS THERE.

CIRCUMAMBULATE THE CITY OF DREAMY SABBATH AFTERNOON. GO FROM CORLEARS HOOK 2 COENTIEZ SLIP, AND FROM THENCE, BY WHITEHALL, NORTHWARD. WHAT DO YOU ZEE? — POSTD LIKE SILENT ZENTINELS ALL AROUND THE TOWN, STAND THOUSANDZ UPON THOUSANDZ OF MORTAL MEN FIXD IN OCEAN REVERIEZ. SOME LEANIN AGAINZT THE SPILEZ; SOME ZEATD UPON THE PIR-HEADZ; SOME LOOKIN OVR THE BULWARKZ OF SHIPS FROM CHINA; SOME HIGH ALOFT IN THE RIGGIN, AS IF STRIVIN 2 GET STILL BETTR ZEAWARD PEEP. BUT THEEZ ARE ALL LANDZMEN; OF WEEK DAIS PENT UP IN LATH AND PLASTR — TID 2 COUNTERS, NAILD 2 BENCHEZ, CLINCHD 2 DEZKZ. HOW THEN IS THIS? ARE THE GREEN FIELDZ GONE? WHAT DO THEY HERE?

BUT LOOK! HERE COME MORE CROWDZ, PACIN STRAITE 4 THE WATR, AND ZEEMINGLY BOUND 4 DIV. STRANGE! NOTHIN WILL CONTENT THEM BUT THE EXTREMEZT LIMIT OF THE LAND; LOITERIN UNDR THE SHADY LEE OF YONDR WAREHOUZEZ WILL NOT SUFFICE. NO. THEY MUST GET JUST AS NIGH THE WATR AS THEY POSIBLY CAN WITHOUT FALLIN IN. AND THERE THEY STAND — MILEZ OF THEM — LEAGUEZ. INLANDERS ALL, THEY COME FROM LANEZ AND ALLEYS, STREETS AND AVENUEZ — NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, AND WEZT. YET HERE THEY ALL UNITE. TELL ME, DOEZ THE MAGNETIC VIRTUE OF THE NEEDLEZ OF THE COMPAZEZ OF ALL THOZE SHIPS ATTRACT THEM THITHR?

ONCE MORE. SAY YOU ARE IN THE COUNTRY; IN SOME HIGH LAND OF LAEKZ. TAEK ALMOST ANY PATH YOU PLEAZE, AND 10 2 1 IT CARRIEZ YOU DOWN IN DALE, AND LEAVEZ YOU THERE BY POOL IN THE STREAM. THERE IS MAGIC IN IT. LET THE MOST ABZENT-MINDD OF MEN BE PLUNGD IN HIS DEEPEZT REVERIEZ — STAND THAT MAN ON HIS LEGS, ZET HIS FEET A-GOIN, AND HE WILL INFALLIBLY LEAD YOU 2 WATR, IF WATR THERE BE IN ALL THAT REGION. SHOULD YOU EVR BE ATHIRST IN THE GREAT AMERICAN DEZERT, TRY THIS EXPERIMENT, IF YOUR CARAVAN HAPPEN 2 BE SUPPLID WITH METAFYSICAL PROFEZOR. YEZ, AS EVRY 1 KNOWS, MEDITASHUN AND WATR ARE WEDDD 4 EVR.

BUT HERE IS AN ARTIST. HE DEZIREZ 2 PAINT YOU THE DREAMIEZT, SHADIEZT, QUIETEZT, MOST ENCHANTIN BIT OF ROMANTIC LANDZCAPE IN ALL THE VALLEY OF THE SACO. WHAT IS THE CHIEF ELEMENT HE EMPLOYS? THERE STAND HIS TREEZ, EACH WITH HOLLOW TRUNK, AS IF HERMIT AND CRUCIFIX WERE WITHIN; AND HERE SLEEPS HIS MEADOW, AND THERE SLEEP HIS KATTLE; AND UP FROM YONDR COTTAGE GOEZ SLEEPY SMOKE. DEEP INTO DISTANT WOODLANDZ WINDZ MAZY WAY, REACHIN 2 OVERLAPPIN SPURS OF MOUNTAINZ BATHD IN THEIR HILL-SIDE BLUE. BUT THOUGH THE PICSHUR LIEZ THUS TRANCD, AND THOUGH THIS PINE-TREE SHAEKZ DOWN ITS SIGHS LIKE LEAVEZ UPON THIS SHEFERD’S HEAD, YET ALL WERE VAIN, UNLEZ THE SHEFERD’S EYE WERE FIXD UPON THE MAGIC STREAM BEFORE HIM. GO VISIT THE PRAIRIEZ IN JUNE, WHEN 4 SCOREZ ON SCOREZ OF MILEZ YOU WADE KNEE-DEEP AMONG TIGR-LILIEZ — WHAT IS THE 1 CHARM WANTIN? — WATR — THERE IS NOT DROP OF WATR THERE! WERE NIAGARA BUT KATARACT OF SAND, WOULD YOU TRAVEL YOUR THOUSAND MILEZ 2 ZEE IT? WHY DID THE POOR POET OF TENNEZZEE, UPON SUDDENLY RECEIVIN 2 HANDFULS OF SILVR, DELIBERATE WHETHR 2 BUY HIM COT, WHICH HE SADLY NEEDD, OR INVEZT HIS MONEY IN PEDEZTRIAN TRIP 2 ROKAWAY BEACH? WHY IS ALMOST EVRY ROBUST HEALTHY BOI WITH ROBUST HEALTHY SOUL IN HIM, AT SOME TIME OR OTHR CRAZY 2 GO 2 ZEA? WHY UPON YOUR FIRST VOYAGE AS PAZENGR, DID YOU YOURZELF FEEL SUCH MYSTICAL VIBRASHUN, WHEN FIRST TOLD THAT YOU AND YOUR SHIP WERE NOW OUT OF SITE OF LAND? WHY DID THE OLD PERSIANZ HOLD THE ZEA HOLY? WHY DID THE GREEKZ GIV IT ZEPARATE DEITY, AND OWN BROTHR OF JOVE? SURELY ALL THIS IS NOT WITHOUT MEANIN. AND STILL DEEPR THE MEANIN OF THAT STORY OF NARCISUS, HOO BECAUZE HE COULD NOT GRASP THE TORMENTIN, MILD IMAGE HE SAW IN THE FOUNTAIN, PLUNGD INTO IT AND WAS DROWND. BUT THAT SAME IMAGE, WE OURZELVEZ ZEE IN ALL RIVERS AND OCEANZ. IT IS THE IMAGE OF THE UNGRASPABLE FANTOM OF LIFE; AND THIS IS THE KEY 2 IT ALL.

NOW, WHEN I SAY THAT I IZ IN THE HABIT OF GOIN 2 ZEA WHENEVR I BEGIN 2 GROW HAZY ABOUT THE EYEZ, AND BEGIN 2 BE OVR CONZCIOUS OF MY LUNGS, I DO NOT MEAN 2 HAS IT INFERRD THAT I EVR GO 2 ZEA AS PAZENGR. 4 2 GO AS PAZENGR YOU MUST NEEDZ HAS PURZE, AND PURZE IS BUT RAG UNLEZ YOU HAS SOMETHIN IN IT. BEZIDEZ, PAZENGERS GET ZEA-SIK — GROW QUARRELSOME — DON’T SLEEP OF NITEZ — DO NOT ENJOY THEMZELVEZ MUCH, AS GENERAL THIN; — NO, I NEVR GO AS PAZENGR; NOR, THOUGH I IZ SOMETHIN OF SALT, DO I EVR GO 2 ZEA AS COMMODORE, OR CAPTAIN, OR COOK. I ABANDON THE GLORY AND DISTINCSHUN OF SUCH OFFICEZ 2 THOZE HOO LIKE THEM. 4 MY PART, I ABOMINATE ALL HONORABLE REZPECTABLE TOILS, TRIALS, AND TRIBULASHUNZ OF EVRY KIND WHATSOEVR. IT IS QUITE AS MUCH AS I CAN DO 2 TAEK CARE OF MYZELF, WITHOUT TAKIN CARE OF SHIPS, BARQUEZ, BRIGS, SCHOONERS, AND WHAT NOT. AND AS 4 GOIN AS COOK, — THOUGH I CONFEZ THERE IS CONZIDERABLE GLORY IN THAT, COOK BEIN SORT OF OFFICR ON SHIP-BORD — YET, SOMEHOW, I NEVR FANCID BROILIN FOWLS; — THOUGH ONCE BROILD, JUDICIOUSLY BUTTERD, AND JUDGMATICALLY SALTD AND PEPPERD, THERE IS NO 1 HOO WILL SPEAK MORE REZPECTFULLY, NOT 2 SAY REVERENTIALLY, OF BROILD FOWL THAN I WILL. IT IS OUT OF THE IDOLATROUS DOTINGS OF THE OLD EGYPTIANZ UPON BROILD IBIS AND ROSTD RIVR HORZE, THAT YOU ZEE THE MUMMIEZ OF THOZE CREATUREZ IN THEIR HUGE BAEK-HOUZEZ THE PYRAMIDZ.

NO, WHEN I GO 2 ZEA, I GO AS SIMPLE SAILOR, RITE BEFORE THE MAST, PLUMB DOWN INTO THE FORECASTLE, ALOFT THERE 2 THE ROYAL MAST-HEAD. TRUE, THEY RATHR ORDR ME ABOUT SOME, AND MAEK ME JUMP FROM SPAR 2 SPAR, LIKE GRASHOPPR IN MAY MEADOW. AND AT FIRST, THIS SORT OF THIN IS UNPLEASANT ENOUGH. IT TOUCHEZ 1’S ZENZE OF HONOR, PARTICULARLY IF YOU COME OF AN OLD EZTABLISHD FAMILY IN THE LAND, THE VAN RENZZELAERS, OR RANDOLFS, OR HARDICANUTEZ. AND MORE THAN ALL, IF JUST PREVIOUS 2 PUTTIN YOUR HAND INTO THE TAR-POT, YOU HAS BEEN LORDIN IT AS COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTR, MAKIN THE TALLEZT BOIS STAND IN AWE OF YOU. THE TRANZISHUN IS KEEN 1, I ASURE YOU, FROM SCHOOLMASTR 2 SAILOR, AND REQUIREZ STRONG DECOCSHUN OF ZENECA AND THE STOICS 2 ENABLE YOU 2 GRIN AND BEAR IT. BUT EVEN THIS WEARS OFF IN TIME.

WHAT OF IT, IF SOME OLD HUNKZ OF ZEA-CAPTAIN ORDERS ME 2 GET BROOM AND SWEEP DOWN THE DEKZ? WHAT DOEZ THAT INDIGNITY AMOUNT 2, WEIGHD, I MEAN, IN THE SCALEZ OF THE NEW TEZTAMENT? DO YOU THINK THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL THINKZ ANYTHIN THE LEZ OF ME, BECAUZE I PROMPTLY AND REZPECTFULLY OBEY THAT OLD HUNKZ IN THAT PARTICULAR INZTANCE? HOO AIN’T SLAVE? TELL ME THAT. WELL, THEN, HOWEVR THE OLD ZEA-CAPTAINZ MAY ORDR ME ABOUT — HOWEVR THEY MAY THUMP AND PUNCH ME ABOUT, I HAS THE SATISFACSHUN OF KNOWIN THAT IT IS ALL RITE; THAT EVRYBODY ELZE IS 1 WAY OR OTHR ZERVD IN MUCH THE SAME WAY — EITHR IN FYSICAL OR METAFYSICAL POINT OF VIEW, THAT IS; AND SO THE UNIVERSAL THUMP IS PASD ROUND, AND ALL HANDZ SHOULD RUB EACH OTHR’S SHOULDR-BLADEZ, AND BE CONTENT.

AGAIN, I ALWAYS GO 2 ZEA AS SAILOR, BECAUZE THEY MAEK POINT OF PAYIN ME 4 MY TROUBLE, WHEREAS THEY NEVR PAY PAZENGERS SINGLE PENNY THAT I EVR HEARD OF. ON THE CONTRARY, PAZENGERS THEMZELVEZ MUST PAY. AND THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN PAYIN AND BEIN PAID. THE ACT OF PAYIN IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE INFLICSHUN THAT THE 2 ORCHARD THIEVEZ ENTAILD UPON US. BUT BEIN PAID, — WHAT WILL COMPARE WITH IT? THE URBANE ACTIVITY WITH WHICH MAN RECEIVEZ MONEY IS REALLY MARVELLOUS, CONZIDERIN THAT WE SO EARNEZTLY BELIEVE MONEY 2 BE THE ROOT OF ALL EARTHLY ILLS, AND THAT ON NO ACSOUNT CAN MONID MAN ENTR HEAVEN. AH! HOW CHEERFULLY WE CONZIGN OURZELVEZ 2 PERDISHUN!

FINALLY, I ALWAYS GO 2 ZEA AS SAILOR, BECAUZE OF THE HOOLEZOME EXERCIZE AND PURE AIR OF THE 4-CASTLE DEK. 4 AS IN THIS WORLD, HEAD WINDZ ARE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN WINDZ FROM ASTERN (THAT IS, IF YOU NEVR VIOLATE THE PYTHAGOREAN MAXIM), SO 4 THE MOST PART THE COMMODORE ON THE QUARTR-DEK GETS HIS ATMOSFERE AT ZECOND HAND FROM THE SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE. HE THINKZ HE BREATHEZ IT FIRST; BUT NOT SO. IN MUCH THE SAME WAY DO THE COMMONALTY LEAD THEIR LEADERS IN MANY OTHR THINGS, AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEADERS LITTLE SUSPECT IT. BUT WHEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTR HAVIN REPEATEDLY SMELT THE ZEA AS MERCHANT SAILOR, I SHOULD NOW TAEK IT INTO MY HEAD 2 GO ON WHALIN VOYAGE; THIS THE INVISIBLE POLICE OFFICR OF THE FATEZ, HOO HAS THE CONZTANT SURVEILLANCE OF ME, AND ZECRETLY DOGS ME, AND INFLUENCEZ ME IN SOME UNACSOUNTABLE WAY — HE CAN BETTR ANZWR THAN ANY 1 ELZE. AND, DOUBTLEZ, MY GOIN ON THIS WHALIN VOYAGE, FORMD PART OF THE GRAND PROGRAMME OF PROVIDENCE THAT WAS DRAWN UP LONG TIME AGO. IT CAME IN AS SORT OF BRIEF INTERLUDE AND SOLO BETWEEN MORE EXTENZIV PERFORMANCEZ. I TAEK IT THAT THIS PART OF THE BILL MUST HAS RUN SOMETHIN LIKE THIS:

“GRAND CONTEZTD ELECSHUN 4 THE PREZIDENCY OF THE UNITD STATEZ. “WHALIN VOYAGE BY 1 ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY IT WAS EXACTLY THAT THOZE STAGE MANAGERS, THE FATEZ, PUT ME DOWN 4 THIS SHABBY PART OF WHALIN VOYAGE, WHEN OTHERS WERE ZET DOWN 4 MAGNIFICENT PARTS IN HIGH TRAGEDIEZ, AND SHORT AND EASY PARTS IN GENTEEL COMEDIEZ, AND JOLLY PARTS IN FARCEZ — THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY THIS WAS EXACTLY; YET, NOW THAT I RECALL ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCEZ, I THINK I CAN ZEE LITTLE INTO THE SPRINGS AND MOTIVEZ WHICH BEIN CUNNINGLY PREZENTD 2 ME UNDR VARIOUS DISGUIZEZ, INDUCD ME 2 ZET ABOUT PERFORMIN THE PART I DID, BEZIDEZ CAJOLIN ME INTO THE DELUSHUN THAT IT WAS CHOICE REZULTIN FROM MY OWN UNBIASD FREEWILL AND DISCRIMINATIN JUDGMENT.

CHIEF AMONG THEEZ MOTIVEZ WAS THE OVERWHELMIN IDEA OF THE GREAT WHALE HIMZELF. SUCH PORTENTOUS AND MYSTERIOUS MONZTR ROUSD ALL MY CURIOSITY. THEN THE WILD AND DISTANT ZEAS WHERE HE ROLLD HIS ISLAND BULK; THE UNDELIVERABLE, NAMELEZ PERILS OF THE WHALE; THEEZ, WITH ALL THE ATTENDIN MARVELS OF THOUSAND PATAGONIAN SITEZ AND SOUNDZ, HELPD 2 SWAY ME 2 MY WISH. WITH OTHR MEN, PERHAPS, SUCH THINGS WOULD NOT HAS BEEN INDUCEMENTS; BUT AS 4 ME, I IZ TORMENTD WITH AN EVRLASTIN ITCH 4 THINGS REMOTE. I LOVE 2 SAIL FORBIDDEN ZEAS, AND LAND ON BARBAROUS COSTS. NOT IGNORIN WHAT IS GUD, I IZ QUIK 2 PERCEIV HORROR, AND COULD STILL BE SOCIAL WITH IT — WOULD THEY LET ME — SINCE IT IS BUT WELL 2 BE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH ALL THE INMATEZ OF THE PLACE 1 LODGEZ IN.

BY REASON OF THEEZ THINGS, THEN, THE WHALIN VOYAGE WAS WELCOME; THE GREAT FLOOD-GATEZ OF THE WONDR-WORLD SWUNG OPEN, AND IN THE WILD CONCEITS THAT SWAYD ME 2 MY PURPOZE, 2 AND 2 THERE FLOTD INTO MY INMOST SOUL, ENDLEZ PROCEZHUNZ OF THE WHALE, AND, MID MOST OF THEM ALL, 1 GRAND HOODD FANTOM, LIKE SNOW HILL IN THE AIR.

I WENT AND GOT SOME FOOD SO WE HAD BETTR EAT IT. ARE YOU TIRD OF THIS YET?

THE "ELEET" FILTR SPECIALLY HANDLEZ THE WORDZ ELITE AND PORN, WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE, LIKE ELITENEZ AND PORNOGRAFY, AND UN-ELITE, AND ANTIPORNOGRAFY.
