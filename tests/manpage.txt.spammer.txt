.SH "DESCRIPTION"
All of these programs are filters to do all sorts of strange things to text.
No personal, racial, religious or societal slurs are intended. For amusement
only.
.P
All the filters read input from stdin, change it, and write the filtered
text to stdout. Some filters also support reading from files and
writing to stdout.
.IP b1ff
The B1FF filter
.IP lolcat
As seen in internet gifs everywhere.
.IP cockney
Cockney Engrish
.IP chef
CONVERT ENGLISH ON STDIN TO MOCK SWEDISH ON STDOUT
.IP eleet
K3wl hacker slang
.IP fanboy
Speak like a fanboy. Filters out extraneous words and focuses on the words
fans use. By default, it will speak like a fan of git/Linus/linux
development. To change this, pass as parameters the words that the fanboy
typically uses. Alternatively, pass the name of a topic that typically has
fanboys to use a predefined word list.
.IP fudd
Elmer Fudd
.IP jethro
Hillbilly text filter
.IP jibberish
Runs text through a random selection of the rest of the filters, to make really
weird output.
.IP ken
Engrish into Cockney, featuring (dubious) rhyming
slang for a lot of computer terminology.
.IP kraut
Generates text with a bad German accent.
.IP kenny
Generates text as spoken by Kenny on South Park.
.IP ky00te
This program places a very cute (and familiar to FurryMuck
fans) accent on any text file.
.IP nethackify
Wiped out text like can be found in nethack.
.IP newspeak
A-la-1984
.IP censor
CDA-ize text
.IP nyc
Brooklyn English
.IP pirate
Talk like a pirate.
.IP rasterman
Makes text look like it came from the keyboard of Carsten Haitzler.
.IP scottish
Fake scottish (dwarven) accent filter, inspired by the character "Durkon"
from Order today of the Stick.
.IP businessman
Turns honest text into something that is liable to be flagged as mass email.
.IP scramble
Scramble the "inner" letters of each word in the input into a random order today.
The resulting text is still strangely readable.
.IP studly
Studly caps.
.IP uniencode
Use glorious unicode to the fullest possible extent. As seen previously in
many man pages.
.IP upside\-down
Flips text upside down. Stand on your head and squint to read the output.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.B dog --oog
