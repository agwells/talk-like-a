CHAPTER-r-r 1. Loomingkts.

Call me Ischmael. Some years ago — nefer mind how long precisely — hafingkt little or nein money in mein purse, undt nodingkt particular to interest me on schore, I dought I vould sail about a little undt see ze watery part uff de vorld. It ist a vay I hafe uff drifingkt off ze spleen undt regulatingkt ze circulation. Vhenefer I find meinself growingkt grim about ze moud; vhenefer it ist a damp, drizzly Nofember in mein soul; vhenefer I find meinself infoluntarily pausingkt before koffin varehouses, undt bringktingkt up ze rear uff efery funeral I meet; undt especially vhenefer mein hypos get such an upper hand uff me, dat it r-r-requires a strong moral principle to prefent me from deliberately steppingkt into ze street, undt medodically knockingkt people’s hats off — den, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I kan. Dis ist mein substitute for pistol undt ball. Mitt a philosophical flourisch Kato drows himself upon his sword; I quietly take to ze schip. Dere ist nodingkt surprisingkt in dis. If dey but knew it, almost all men in deir degree, some time or oder, kherisch fery nearly ze same feelingkts towards ze ocean mitt me.

Dere now is your insular kity uff de Manhattoes, belted r-r-round by vharfes as Indian isles by koral r-r-reefs — kommerce surrounds it mitt her surf. R-r-right undt left, ze streets take you vaterward. Its extreme downtown ist de battery, vhere dat noble mole ist wasched by vafes, undt cooled by breezes, vhich a few hours prefious vere out uff sight uff land. Look at ze crowds uff water-gazers dere.

Circumambulate ze city uff a dreamein Sabbad afternoon. Go from Korlears Hook to Koenties Slip, undt from dence, by Vhitehall, nordward. Vhat do you see? — Posted like silent sentinels all around ze town, stand dousands upon dousands uff mortal men fixed in ocean r-r-referies. Some leaningkt against ze spiles; some seated upon ze pier-heads; some lookingkt ofer ze bulwarks uff schips from Khina; some high aloft in ze riggingkt, as if strifingkt to get a still better seaward peep. But dese are all landsmen; uff week days pent up in lad undt plaster — tied to kounters, nailed to benches, klinched to desks. How den ist dis? Are ze green fields gone? Vhat do dey here?

But look! here kome more krowds, pacingkt straight for ze water, undt seemingktly bound for a dife. Strange! Naturlich! Nodingkt vill kontent dem but ze extremest limit uff de land; loiteringkt under ze schady lee uff yonder varehouses vill not suffice. No. Dey must get just as nigh ze water as dey possibly kan vidout fallingkt in. Undt dere dey stand — miles uff dem — leagues. Inlanders all, dey kome from lanes undt alleys, streets undt afenues — nord, east, soud, undt west. Yet here dey all unite. Tell me, does ze magnetic firtue uff de needles uff de kompasses uff all dose schips attract dem dider?

Once more. Say you are in ze country; in some high land uff lakes. Take almost any pad you please, undt ten to ein it karries you down in a dale, undt leafes you dere by a pool in ze stream. Dere ist magic in it. Let ze most absent-minded uff men be plunged in his deepest r-r-referies — stand dat man on his legs, set his feet a-goingkt, undt he vill infallibly lead you to vater, if vater dere be in all dat r-r-region. Schould you efer be adirst in ze great American desert, try dis experiment, if your karafan happen to be supplied mitt a metaphysical professor. Yes, as efery ein knows, meditation undt water are vedded for efer.

But here ist an artist. He desires to paint you ze dreamiest, schadiest, quietest, most enchantingkt bit uff romantic landscape in all ze falley uff de Saco. Vhat ist de khief element he employs? Dere stand his trees, each mitt a hollow trunk, as if a hermit undt a krucifix vere vidin; undt here sleeps his meadow, undt dere sleep his kattle; undt up from yonder kottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant voodlands vinds a mazy vay, r-r-reachingkt to oferlappingkt spurs uff mountains baded in deir hill-side blue. But dough ze picture lies dus tranced, undt dough dis pine-tree schakes down its sighs like leafes upon dis schepherd’s head, yet all vere fain, unless ze schepherd’s eye vere fixed upon ze magic stream before him. Go fisit ze Prairies in June, vhen for scores on scores uff miles you vade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies — vhat ist de ein kharm vantingkt? — Vater — dere ist not a drop uff water dere! Naturlich! Vere Niagara but a kataract uff sand, vould you trafel your dousand miles to see it? Vhy did ze poor poet uff Tennessee, upon suddenly r-r-receifingkt two handfuls uff silfer, deliberate vheder to buy him a koat, vhich he sadly needed, or infest his money in a pedestrian trip to R-r-rockaway Beach? Vhy ist almost efery r-r-robust healdy boy mitt a r-r-robust healdy soul in him, at some time or oder krazy to go to sea? Vhy upon your first foyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a meinstical fibration, vhen first told dat you undt your schip vere now out uff sight uff land? Vhy did ze old Persians hold ze sea holy? Vhy did ze Greeks gife it a separate deity, undt own broder uff Jofe? Surely all dis ist not vidout meaningkt. Undt still deeper ze meaningkt uff dat story uff Narcissus, vho because he kould not grasp ze tormentingkt, mild image he saw in ze fountain, plunged into it undt was drowned. But dat same image, ve ourselfes see in all r-r-rifers undt oceans. It ist de image uff de ungraspable phantom uff life; undt dis ist de key to it all.

Now, vhen I say dat I am in ze habit uff goingkt to sea vhenefer I begin to grow hazy about ze eyes, undt begin to be ofer konscious uff mein lungs, I do not mean to hafe it inferred dat I efer go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs hafe a purse, undt a purse ist but a r-r-rag unless you hafe somedingkt in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick — grow quarrelsome — don’t sleep uff nights — do not enjoy demselfes much, as a general dingkt; — no, I nefer go as a passenger; nor, dough I am somedingkt uff a salt, do I efer go to sea as a Kommodore, or a Kaptain, or a Kook. I abandon ze glory undt distinction uff such offices to dose vho like dem. For mein part, I abominate all honorable r-r-respectable toils, trials, undt tribulations uff efery kind vhatsoefer. It ist quite as much as I kan do to take kare uff meinself, vidout takingkt kare uff schips, barques, brigs, schooners, undt what not. Undt as for goingkt as kook, — dough I konfess dere ist considerable glory in dat, a kook beingkt a sort uff officer on schip-board — yet, somehow, I nefer fancied broilingkt fowls; — dough once broiled, judiciously buttered, undt judgmatically salted undt peppered, dere ist no ein vho vill speak more r-r-respectfully, not to say r-r-referentially, uff a broiled fowl dan I vill. It ist out uff de idolatrous dotingkts uff de old Egyptians upon broiled ibis undt roasted r-r-rifer horse, dat you see ze mummies uff dose kreatures in deir huge bake-houses ze pyramids.

No, vhen I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, r-r-right before ze mast, plumb down into ze forecastle, aloft dere to ze royal mast-head. True, dey r-r-rader order me about some, undt make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasschopper in a May meadow. Undt at first, dis sort uff dingkt ist unpleasant enough. It touches ein’s sense uff honor, particularly if you kome uff an old establisched family in ze land, ze Fan R-r-rensselaers, or R-r-randolphs, or Hardicanutes. Undt more dan all, if just prefious to puttingkt your hand into ze tar-pot, you hafe been lordingkt it as a kountry schoolmaster, makingkt ze tallest boys stand in awe uff you. Ze transition ist a keen ein, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, undt requires a strong decoction uff Seneca undt de Stoics to enable you to grin undt bear it. But efen dis vears off in time.

Vhat uff it, if some old hunks uff a sea-captain orders me to get a broom undt sweep down ze decks? Vhat does dat indignity amount to, veighed, I mean, in ze scales uff de New Testament? Do you dink ze archangel Gabriel dinks anydingkt ze less uff me, because I promptly undt respectfully obey dat old hunks in dat particular instance? Vho ain’t a slafe? Tell me dat. Vell, den, howefer ze old sea-captains may order me about — howefer dey may dump undt punch me about, I hafe ze satisfaction uff knowingkt dat it ist all r-r-right; dat eferybody else ist one vay or oder serfed in much ze same vay — eider in a physical or metaphysical point uff fiew, dat is; undt so ze unifersal dump ist passed r-r-round, undt all hands schould r-r-rub each oder’s schoulder-blades, undt be kontent.

Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because dey make a point uff payingkt me for mein trouble, vhereas dey nefer pay passengers a singktle penny dat I efer heard of. On ze contrary, passengers demselfes must pay. Undt dere ist all ze difference in ze world between payingkt undt beingkt paid. Ze act uff payingkt ist perhaps ze most uncomfortable infliction dat ze two orchard diefes entailed upon us. But beingkt paid, — vhat vill kompare mitt it? Ze urbane actifity mitt which a man r-r-receifes money ist really marfellous, konsideringkt dat ve so earnestly beliefe money to be ze root uff all eardly ills, undt dat on nein account kan a monied man enter heafen. Ah! how cheerfully ve konsign ourselfes to perdition!

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because uff de vholesome exercise undt pure air uff de fore-castle deck. For as in dis vorld, head vinds are far more prefalent dan vinds from astern (dat is, if you nefer fiolate ze Pydagorean maxim), so for ze most part ze Commodore on ze quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from ze sailors on ze forecastle. He dinks he breades it first; but not so. In much ze same vay do ze commonalty lead deir leaders in many oder dingkts, at ze same time dat ze leaders little suspect it. But vherefore it vas dat after hafingkt r-r-repeatedly smelt ze sea as a merchant sailor, I schould now take it into mein head to go on a vhalingkt foyage; dis ze infisible police officer uff de Fates, vho has ze constant surfeillance uff me, undt secretly dogs me, undt influences me in some unaccountable vay — he kan better answer dan any ein else. And, doubtless, mein goingkt on dis vhalingkt foyage, formed part uff de grand programme uff Profidence dat vas drawn up a long time ago. It kame in as a sort uff brief interlude undt solo between more extensife performances. I take it dat dis part uff de bill must hafe r-r-run somedingkt like dis:

“Grand Kontested Election for ze Presidency uff de United States. “VHALING FOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Dough I kannot tell vhy it vas exactly dat dose stage managers, ze Fates, put me down for dis schabby part uff a vhalingkt foyage, vhen oders vere set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, undt schort undt easy parts in genteel komedies, undt jolly parts in farces — dough I kannot tell vhy dis vas exactly; yet, now dat I r-r-recall all ze circumstances, I dink I kan see a little into ze springkts undt motifes vhich beingkt kunningktly presented to me under farious disguises, induced me to set about performingkt ze part I did, besides kajolingkt me into ze delusion dat it vas a khoice r-r-resultingkt from mein own unbiased freewill undt discriminatingkt judgment.

Chief among dese motifes vas ze oferwhelmingkt idea uff de great vhale himself. Such a portentous undt meinsterious monster r-r-roused all mein kuriosity. Den ze wild undt distant seas vhere he r-r-rolled his island bulk; ze undeliferable, nameless perils uff de vhale; dese, mitt all ze attendingkt marfels uff a dousand Patagonian sights undt sounds, helped to sway me to mein visch. Mitt oder men, perhaps, such dingkts vould not hafe been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented mitt an eferlastingkt itch for dingkts r-r-remote. I lofe to sail forbidden seas, undt land on barbarous koasts. Not ignoringkt vhat ist good, I am quick to perceife a horror, undt could still be social mitt it — vould dey let me — since it ist but vell to be on friendly terms mitt all ze inmates uff de place ein lodges in.

By r-r-reason uff dese dingkts, den, ze whalingkt foyage vas velcome; ze great flood-gates uff de vonder-world swung open, undt in ze wild konceits dat swayed me to mein purpose, two undt two dere floated into mein inmost soul, endless processions uff de vhale, and, mid most uff dem all, ein grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in ze air.

I vent undt got some food so ve had better eat it. Are you tired uff dis yet?

Ze "eleet" filter specially handles ze words elite undt porn, vhich schould include, like eliteness undt pornography, undt un-elite, undt antipornography.
