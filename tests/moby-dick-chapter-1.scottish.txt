CHAPTER 1. Loomin's.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—ne'er mind how long precisely—havin' little or nay money in me purse, an' nuthin' particular ta interest me on shore, I thought I would sail aboot a little an' see tha watery part o' tha world. It be a way I haf o' drivin' off tha sple'n an' regulatin' tha circulation. Whene'er I find meself growin' grim aboot tha mouth; whene'er it be a damp, drizzly Novemb'r in me soul; whene'er I find meself involuntarily pausin' 'fore coffin warehouses, an' brin'in' up tha rear o' ev'ry funeral I meet; an' 'speci'lly whene'er me hypos get such an upper hand o' me, tha it requires a strong moral principle ta prevent me from deliberately steppin' inta tha street, an' methodic'lly knockin' people’s hats off—than, I account it high time ta get ta sea as soon as I can. 'Tis be me substitute fer pistol an' ball. Wit' a philosophical flourish Cata throws 'imself upon his sword; I quietly take ta tha ship. Thar be nuthin' surprisin' in 'tis. If'n thay but knew it, almost all m'n in thar degree, some time or othar, cherish very nearly tha same feelin's towards tha ocean wit' me.

Thar now be yer insular city o' tha Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it wit' her surf. Right an' left, tha streets take ye waterward. Its 'streme downtown be tha battery, where tha noble mole be washed by waves, an' cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were outta sight o' land. Look at tha crowds o' water-gazers thar.

Circumambulate tha city o' a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook ta Coenties Slip, an' from thance, by Whitehall, northward. What do ye see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around tha town, stand thousands upon thousands o' mortal m'n fixed in ocean reveries. Some leanin' against tha spiles; some seated upon tha pier-heads; some lookin' o'er tha bulwarks o' ships from China; some high aloft in tha riggin', as if'n strivin' ta git a still better seaward peep. But thase be all landsm'n; o' week days pent up in lath an' plaster—tied ta counters, nailed ta benches, clinched ta desks. How than be 'tis? Be tha gre'n fields gone? What do thay 'ere?

But look! 'ere come more crowds, pacin' straight fer tha water, an' seemin'ly bound fer a dive. Strange! Nuthin' will content 'em but tha 'stremest limit o' tha land; loiterin' under tha shady lee o' yonder warehouses will na suffice. Nay. Thay must get just as nigh tha water as thay possibly can without fallin' in. An' thar thay stand—miles o' 'em—leagues. Inlanders all, thay come from lanes an' alleys, streets an' avenues—north, east, south, an' west. Yet 'ere thay all unite. Tell me, does tha magnetic virtue o' tha needles o' tha compasses o' all those ships attract 'em thithar?

Once more. Say ye be in tha country; in some high land o' lakes. Take almost any path ye please, an' t'n ta 'un it carries ye down in a dale, an' leaves ye thar by a pool in tha stream. Thar be magic in it. Let tha most absent-minded o' m'n be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand tha man on his legs, set his feet a-goin', an' 'e will infallibly lead ye ta water, if'n water thar be in all tha region. Should ye e'er be athirst in tha great American desert, try 'tis 'sperimn't, if'n yer caravan happ'n ta be supplied wit' a metaphysical professor. Aye, as ev'ry 'un knows, meditation an' water be wedded fer e'er.

But 'ere be an artist. 'E desires ta paint ye tha dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchantin' bit o' romantic landscape in all tha valley o' tha Saco. What be tha chief elemn't 'e employs? Thar stand his trees, each wit' a hollow trunk, as if'n a hermit an' a crucifix were within; an' 'ere sleeps his meadow, an' thar sleep his cattle; an' up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep inta distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reachin' ta overlappin' spurs o' mountains bathad in thar hill-side blue. But though tha picture lies thus tranced, an' though 'tis pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon 'tis shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless tha shepherd’s eye were fixed upon tha magic stream 'fore 'im. Go visit tha Prairies in June, wh'n fer scores on scores o' miles ye wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what be tha 'un charm wantin'?—Water—thar be na a drop o' water thar! Were Niagara but a cataract o' sand, would ye travel yer thousand miles ta see it? Why did tha poor poet o' Tennessee, upon sudd'nly receivin' two handfuls o' sil'er, deliberate whethar ta buy 'im a coat, which 'e sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip ta Rockaway Beach? Why be almost ev'ry robust healthy boy wit' a robust healthy soul in 'im, at some time or othar crazy ta go ta sea? Why upon yer first voyage as a pass'nger, did ye yerself feel such a mestical vibration, wh'n first told tha ye an' yer ship were now outta sight o' land? Why did tha old Persians hold tha sea holy? Why did tha Greeks give it a separate deity, an' own brothar o' Jove? Surely all 'tis be na without meanin'. An' still deeper tha meanin' o' tha story o' Narcissus, who 'cause 'e could na grasp tha tormn'tin', mild image 'e saw in tha fountain, plunged inta it an' was drown'd. But tha same image, we ourselves see in all rivers an' oceans. It be tha image o' tha ungrasp'ble phantom o' life; an' 'tis be tha key ta it all.

Now, wh'n I say tha I am in tha habit o' goin' ta sea whene'er I begin ta grow hazy aboot tha eyes, an' begin ta be o'er conscious o' me lungs, I do na mean ta haf it inferred tha I e'er go ta sea as a pass'nger. Fer ta go as a pass'nger ye must needs haf a purse, an' a purse be but a rag unless ye haf somethin' in it. Besides, pass'ngers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep o' nights—do na enjoy 'emselves much, as a general thin';—nay, I ne'er go as a pass'nger; nor, though I am somethin' o' a salt, do I e'er go ta sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon tha glory an' distinction o' such offices ta those who like 'em. Fer me part, I abominate all honor'ble respect'ble toils, trials, an' tribulations o' ev'ry kind whatsoe'er. It be quite as much as I can do ta take care o' meself, without takin' care o' ships, barques, brigs, schooners, an' what na. An' as fer goin' as cook,—though I confess thar be consider'ble glory in tha, a cook bein' a sort o' officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I ne'er fancied broilin' fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously butt'red, an' judgmatic'lly salted an' pepp'red, thar be nay 'un who will speak more respectfully, na ta say reverenti'lly, o' a broiled fowl than I will. It be outta tha idolatrous dotin's o' tha old Egyptians upon broiled ibis an' roasted ri'er horse, tha ye see tha mummies o' those creatures in thar huge bake-houses tha pyramids.

Nay, wh'n I go ta sea, I go as a simple sailor, right 'fore tha mast, plumb down inta tha forecastle, aloft thar ta tha royal mast-head. True, thay rathar order me aboot some, an' make me jump from spar ta spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. An' at first, 'tis sort o' thin' be unpleasant enough. It touches 'un’s sense o' honor, particularly if'n ye come o' an old 'st'blished family in tha land, tha Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. An' more than all, if'n just previous ta puttin' yer hand inta tha tar-pot, ye haf be'n lordin' it as a country schoolmaster, makin' tha tallest boys stand in awe o' ye. Tha transition be a ke'n 'un, I assure ye, from a schoolmaster ta a sailor, an' requires a strong decoction o' Seneca an' tha Stoics ta en'ble ye ta grin an' bear it. But ev'n 'tis wears off in time.

What o' it, if'n some old hunks o' a sea-captain orders me ta git a broom an' sweep down tha decks? What does tha indignity amount ta, weighed, I mean, in tha scales o' tha New Testamn't? Do ye think tha archangel Gabriel thinks anythin' tha less o' me, 'cause I promptly an' respectfully obey tha old hunks in tha particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me tha. Well, than, howe'er tha old sea-captains may order me aboot—howe'er thay may thump an' punch me aboot, I haf tha satisfaction o' knowin' tha it be all right; tha everybody else be 'un way or othar served in much tha same way—eithar in a physical or metaphysical point o' view, tha be; an' s'tha universal thump be passed round, an' all hands should rub each othar’s shoulder-blades, an' be content.

Again, I always go ta sea as a sailor, 'cause thay make a point o' payin' me fer me trouble, whereas thay ne'er pay pass'ngers a sin'le penny tha I e'er heard o'. On tha contrary, pass'ngers 'emselves must pay. An' thar be all tha difference in tha world betwe'n payin' an' bein' paid. Tha act o' payin' be perhaps tha most uncomfort'ble infliction tha tha two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But bein' paid,—what will compare wit' it? Tha urbane activity wit which a man receives money be re'lly marvellous, considerin' tha we so earnestly believe money ta be tha root o' all earthly ills, an' tha on nay account can a monied man enter heav'n. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves ta perdition!

Fin'lly, I always go ta sea as a sailor, 'cause o' tha wholesome 'sercise an' pure air o' tha fore-castle deck. Fer as in 'tis world, head winds be far more prevalent than winds from astern (tha be, if'n ye ne'er violate tha Pythagorean maxim), so fer tha most part tha Commodore on tha quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from tha sailors on tha forecastle. 'E thinks 'e breathas it first; but na so. In much tha same way do tha commonalty lead thar leaders in many othar thin's, at tha same time tha tha leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was tha after havin' repeatedly smelt tha sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it inta me head ta go on a whalin' voyage; 'tis tha invisible police officer o' tha Fates, who has tha constant surveillance o' me, an' secretly dogs me, an' influences me in some unaccount'ble way—'e can better answer than any 'un else. An', doubtless, me goin' on 'tis whalin' voyage, formed part o' tha grand programme o' Providence tha was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort o' brief interlude an' solo betwe'n more 'stensive performances. I take it tha 'tis part o' tha bill must haf run somethin' like 'tis:

“Grand Contested Election fer tha Presidency o' tha United States. “WHALIN' VOYAGE BY 'UN ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Though I cannae tell why it was 'sactly tha those stage managers, tha Fates, put me down fer 'tis shabby part o' a whalin' voyage, wh'n othars were set down fer magnificent parts in high tragedies, an' short an' easy parts in genteel comedies, an' jolly parts in farces—though I cannae tell why 'tis was 'sactly; yet, now tha I recall all tha circumstances, Methinks I can see a little inta tha sprin's an' motives which bein' cunnin'ly presented ta me under various disguises, induced me ta set aboot performin' tha part I did, besides cajolin' me inta tha delusion tha it was a choice resultin' from me own unbiased freewill an' discriminatin' judgmn't.

Chief among thase motives was tha overwhelmin' idea o' tha great whale 'imself. Such a portentous an' mesterious monster roused all me curiosity. Than tha wild an' distant seas where 'e rolled his island bulk; tha undeliver'ble, nameless perils o' tha whale; thase, wit' all tha attendin' marvels o' a thousand Patagonian sights an' sounds, helped ta sway me ta me wish. Wit' othar m'n, perhaps, such thin's would na haf be'n inducemn'ts; but as fer me, I am tormn'ted wit' an everlastin' itch fer thin's remote. I love ta sail forbidd'n seas, an' land on barbarous coasts. Na ignorin' what be good, I am quick ta perceive a horror, an' could still be social wit' it—would thay let me—since it be but well ta be on friendly terms wit' all tha inmates o' tha place 'un lodges in.

By reason o' thase thin's, than, tha whalin' voyage was welcome; tha great flood-gates o' tha wonder-world swung op'n, an' in tha wild conceits tha swayed me ta me purpose, two an' two thar floated inta me inmost soul, endless processions o' tha whale, an', mid most o' 'em all, 'un grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in tha air.
