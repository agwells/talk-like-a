CHAPTER 1. Loomings.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago — nevuh mind how long precisely — havin' little
ore nope money in mah purse, and nothin' particular tuh interest me on shouh, Ah
thought Ah would sail about ah little and see duh watery part uv duh world. Tis
ah way Ah got uv drivin' off duh spleen and regulatin' duh circulashun. Whenevuh
Ah find myself growin' grim about duh mouth; whenevuh tis ah damp, drizzly
Novembuh in mah soul; whenevuh Ah find myself involuntarily pausin' befouh coffin
warehouses, and bringin' up duh rear uv ever funeral Ah meet; and especially
whenevuh mah hypos get such ah uppuh hand uv me, that it requires ah strong moral
principle tuh prevent me from deliberately steppin' into duh street, and
methodically knockin' people’s hats off — then, Ah account it high time tuh get tuh
sea as soon as Ah c'n. This is mah substitute fer pistol and ball. With ah
philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; Ah quietly take tuh duh
ship. Theuh is nothin' surprisin' in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
in their degree, some time ore othuh, cherish right nearly duh same feelings
towards duh ocean with me.

Theuh now is yore insular city uv duh Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
Indian isles by coral reefs — commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and
left, duh streets take y'all waterward. Its extreme downtoed is duh battery, wheuh
that noble mole is warshed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which ah few hours
prevyus wuz out uv sight uv land. Look at duh crowds uv watuh-gazers theuh.

Circumambulate duh city uv ah dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook tuh
Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do y'all see? —
Posted like silent sentinels all around duh town, stand thousands upon thousands
uv mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leanin' against duh spiles; some
seated upon duh piuh-heads; some lookin' ovuh duh bulwarks uv ships from China;
some high aloft in duh riggin', as if strivin' tuh get ah still bettuh seaward
peep. But these is all landsmen; uv week days pent up in lath and plastuh —
tied tuh counters, nailed tuh benches, clinched tuh desks. How then is this? Is
duh green fields gone? What do they heuh?

But look. Ye DAWGies!!! heuh come mo crowds, pacin' straight fer duh watuh, and seemingly
bound fer ah dive. Strange. Ye DAWGies!!! Nothin' will content em but duh extremest limit uv
duh land; loiterin' unduh duh shady lee uv yonduh warehouses will not suffice.
Nope. They must get just as nigh duh watuh as they possibly c'n without fallin'
in. And theuh they stand — miles uv em — leagues. Inlanders all, they come
from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues — north, east, south, and west. Yet
heuh they all unite. Tell me, does duh magnetic virtue uv duh needles uv duh
compasses uv all those ships attract em thithuh?

Once mo. Say y'all is in duh country; in some high land uv lakes. Take almost
any path y'all please, and ten tuh one it carries y'all down in ah dale, and leaves
y'all theuh by ah pool in duh stream. Theuh is magic in it. Let duh most
absent-minded uv men be plunged in his deepest reveries — stand that man on his
legs, set his feet ah-goin', and he will infallibly lead y'all tuh watuh, if watuh
theuh be in all that region. Ortta y'all evuh be athirst in duh great American
desert, try this experiment, if yore caravan happen tuh be supplied with ah
metaphysical professor. Yep, as ever one knows, meditashun and watuh is wedded
fer evuh.

But heuh is ah artist. He desires tuh paint y'all duh dreamiest, shadiest,
quietest, most enchantin' bit uv romantic landscape in all duh valley uv duh
Saco. What is duh chief element he employs? Theuh stand his trees, each with ah
holler trunk, as if ah hermit and ah crucifix wuz within; and heuh sleeps his
meader, and theuh sleep his cattle; and up from yonduh cottage goes ah sleepy
smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds ah mazy way, reachin' tuh overlappin'
spurs uv mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though duh pictuuh lies
thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon
this shepherd’s head, yet all wuz vain, unless duh shepherd’s eye wuz fixed
upon duh magic stream befouh him. Go visit duh Prairies in June, when fer scores
on scores uv miles y'all wade knee-deep among Tiguh-lilies — what is duh one charm
hankerin' aftuh? — Watuh — theuh is not ah drop uv watuh theuh. Ye DAWGies!!! Wuz Niagara but ah
cataract uv sand, would y'all travel yore thousand miles tuh see it? Why did duh
poor poet uv Tennessee, upon suddenly receivin' two handfuls uv silvuh,
deliberate whethuh tuh buy him ah coat, which he sadly needed, ore invest his money
in ah pedestrian trip tuh Rockaway Beach? Why is almost ever robust healthy boy
with ah robust healthy soul in him, at some time ore othuh crazy tuh go tuh sea? Why
upon yore first voyage as ah passenguh, did y'all yoreself feel such ah mystical
vibrashun, when first told that y'all and yore ship wuz now out uv sight uv land?
Why did duh old Persians hold duh sea holy? Why did duh Greeks give it ah
separate deity, and own brothuh uv Jove? Surely all this is not without meanin'.
And still deepuh duh meanin' uv that story uv Narcissus, who because he could
not grasp duh tormentin', mild image he saw in duh fountain, plunged into it and
wuz drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. Tis duh image uv duh ungraspable phantom uv life; and this is duh key tuh it all.

Now, when Ah say that Ah wuz in duh habit uv goin' tuh sea whenevuh Ah begin tuh grow
hazy about duh eyes, and begin tuh be ovuh consshus uv mah lungs, Ah do not mean
tuh got it inferred that Ah evuh go tuh sea as ah passenguh. Fer tuh go as ah
passenguh y'all must needs got ah purse, and ah purse is but ah rag unless y'all got
somethin' in it. Besides, passengers get sea-ailin' — grow quarrelsome — don’t
sleep uv nights — do not enjoy themselves much, as ah general thin'; — nope, Ah
nevuh go as ah passenguh; nor, though Ah wuz somethin' uv ah salt, do Ah evuh go tuh
sea as ah Commodouh, ore ah Captain, ore ah Whomp up. Ah abandon duh glory and distincshun
uv such offices tuh those who like em. Fer mah part, Ah abominate all honorable
respectable toils, trials, and tribulashuns uv ever kind whatsoevuh. Tis
quite as much as Ah c'n do tuh take cauh uv myself, without takin' cauh uv ships,
barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as fer goin' as whomp up, — though Ah
confess theuh is considerable glory in that, ah whomp up bein' ah sort uv officuh on
ship-board — yet, someher, Ah nevuh fancied whompin' up fowls; — though once
done whomped up, judishusly buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, theuh is
nope one who will speak mo respectfully, not tuh say reverenshully, uv ah done whomped up
fowl then Ah will. Tis out uv duh idolatrous dotings uv duh old Egyptians upon
done whomped up ibis and roasted rivuh horse, that y'all see duh mummies uv those
creatures in their huge whomp up-houses duh pyramids.

Nope, when Ah go tuh sea, Ah go as ah simple sailor, right befouh duh mast, plumb down
into duh forecastle, aloft theuh tuh duh royal mast-head. True, they rathuh orduh
me about some, and make me jump from spar tuh spar, like ah grasshoppuh in ah May
meader. And at first, this sort uv thin' is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s
sense uv honor, particularly if y'all come uv ah old established fambly in duh
land, duh Van Rensselaers, ore Randolphs, ore Hardicanutes. And mo then all, if
just prevyus tuh puttin' yore hand into duh tar-pot, y'all got been lordin' it as
ah country schoolmastuh, makin' duh tallest boys stand in awe uv y'all. Duh
transishun is ah keen one, Ah assuuh y'all, from ah schoolmastuh tuh ah sailor, and
requires ah strong decocshun uv Seneca and duh Stoics tuh enable y'all tuh grin and
bear it. But even this wears off in time.

What uv it, if some old hunks uv ah sea-captain orders me tuh get ah broom and
sweep down duh decks? What does that indignity amount tuh, weighed, Ah mean, in
duh scales uv duh New Testament? Do y'all think duh archangel Gabriel thinks
anythin' duh less uv me, because Ah promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks
in that particular instance? Who ain’t ah slave? Tell me that. Well, then,
howevuh duh old sea-captains may orduh me about — howevuh they may thump and
punch me about, Ah got duh satisfacshun uv knowin' that tis all right; that
everbody else is one way ore othuh served in much duh same way — eithuh in ah
physical ore metaphysical point uv view, that is; and so duh universal thump is
passed round, and all hands ortta rub each othuh’s shoulduh-blades, and be
content.

Again, Ah always go tuh sea as ah sailor, because they make ah point uv payin' me
fer mah trouble, whereas they nevuh pay passengers ah single penny that Ah evuh
heard uv. On duh contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And theuh is all duh
difference in duh world between payin' and bein' paid. Duh act uv payin' is
mebbe duh most uncomfortable inflicshun that duh two orchard thieves entailed
upon us. But bein' paid, — what will compauh with it? Duh urbane activity with
which ah man receives money is right marvellous, considerin' that we so
earnestly believe money tuh be duh root uv all earthly ills, and that on nope
account c'n ah monied man entuh heaven. Ah. Ye DAWGies!!! how cheerfully we consign ourselves
tuh perdishun. Ye DAWGies!!!

Finally, Ah always go tuh sea as ah sailor, because uv duh wholesome exercise and
puuh air uv duh fouh-castle deck. Fer as in this world, head winds is far mo
prevalent then winds from astern (that is, if y'all nevuh violate duh Pythagorean
maxim), so fer duh most part duh Commodouh on duh quartuh-deck gets his
atmospheuh at second hand from duh sailors on duh forecastle. He thinks he
breathes it first; but not so. In much duh same way do duh commonalty lead their
leaders in many othuh things, at duh same time that duh leaders little suspect
it. But wherefouh it wuz that aftuh havin' repeatedly smelt duh sea as ah
merchant sailor, Ah ortta now take it into mah head tuh go on ah whalin' voyage;
this duh invisible constable officuh uv duh Fates, who has duh constant
surveillance uv me, and secretly dawgs me, and influences me in some
unaccountable way — he c'n bettuh answuh then any one else. And, doubtless, mah
goin' on this whalin' voyage, formed part uv duh grand programme uv Providence
that wuz draed up ah long time ago. It came in as ah sort uv brief interlude and
solo between mo extensive performances. Ah take it that this part uv duh bill
must got run somethin' like this:

“Grand Contested Elecshun fer duh Presidency uv duh United States. “WHALING
VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Though Ah cannot tell why it wuz exactly that those stage managers, duh Fates,
put me down fer this shabby part uv ah whalin' voyage, when others wuz set down
fer magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel
comedies, and jolly parts in farces — though Ah cannot tell why this wuz exactly;
yet, now that Ah recall all duh circumstances, Ah think Ah c'n see ah little into
duh springs and motives which bein' cunningly presented tuh me unduh varyus
disguises, induced me tuh set about performin' duh part Ah did, besides cajolin'
me into duh delusion that it wuz ah choice resultin' from mah own unbiased
freewill and discriminatin' judgment.

Chief among these motives wuz duh overwhelmin' idea uv duh great whale himself.
Such ah portentous and mysteryus monstuh roused all mah curiosity. Then duh wild
and distant seas wheuh he rolled his island bulk; duh undeliverable, nameless
perils uv duh whale; these, with all duh attendin' marvels uv ah thousand
Patagonian sights and sounds, heped tuh sway me tuh mah wish. With othuh men,
mebbe, such things would not got been inducements; but as fer me, Ah wuz
tormented with ah everlastin' itch fer things remote. Ah love tuh sail forbidden
seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignorin' what is good, Ah wuz quick tuh
perceive ah horror, and could still be social with it — would they let me — since
tis but well tuh be on friendly terms with all duh inmates uv duh place one
lodges in.

By reason uv these things, then, duh whalin' voyage wuz welcome; duh great
flood-gates uv duh wonduh-world swung open, and in duh wild conceits that swayed
me tuh mah purpose, two and two theuh floated into mah inmost soul, endless
processions uv duh whale, and, mid most uv em all, one grand hooded phantom,
like ah sner hill in duh air.

Ah went and got some vittles so we had bettuh eat it. Is y'all tuckered out uv this yet?

Duh "eleet" filtuh specially handles duh words elite and porn, which ortta
include, like eliteness and pornography, and un-elite, and antipornography.
