  That is so.  Have fun (FWIW, I have done some rewriting on them - they are
  now in Perl, but still need some work...)

The rasterman filter was pulled out of

copyright (C) 1997 Zachary Beane and is GPL'd.

  Certainly, it would be an honour to have it included in the Debian
  distribution so I hereby release ken into the public domain.

The ky00te filter is now relicensed under the GPL. Its author, Brent
Edwards, confirmed the new copyright in this email:

  Subject: Re: Is this the author of the ky00te filter?

  Dear Edward,
          You have my permission to put the ky00te filter into the GNU GPL
  license.  (Though the license will be far longer than the program itself!)

                          -- Brent Edwards

  Subject: Re: copyright of newspeak filter

  Hey there -- I'm cleaning out old mail, and don't remember if I replied
  to this or not.  Anyway, in case I didn't -- feel free to slap this 
  license atop the newspeak script (it's BSD-like, so that should work
  for you.)
