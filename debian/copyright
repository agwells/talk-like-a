  That is so.  Have fun (FWIW, I have done some rewriting on them - they are
  now in Perl, but still need some work...)

  Certainly, it would be an honour to have it included in the Debian
  distribution so I hereby release ken into the public domain.

  Hey there -- I'm cleaning out old mail, and don't remember if I replied
  to this or not.  Anyway, in case I didn't -- feel free to slap this 
  license atop the newspeak script (it's BSD-like, so that should work
  for you.)
