filters (2.14) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Aug 2000 22:58:02 -0700

filters (2.10) unstable; urgency=low

filters (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed Makefile to add . to PATH before running makesample.sh, because it
    called jibberish, which looks only in /usr/games for the filters, and if
    you're building filters w/o the package installed, they won't be there
    and the build will fail. Whew! (closes: #33758)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Feb 1999 00:17:24 -0800
