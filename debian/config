# What command to run to install the package into debian/tmp?
# You might want to edit the package's Makefile and add $(PREFIX) 
# to all the paths it installs files to. or, you can just write 
# your own install commands here instead.
#
# Note that debian/* and the files in /usr/doc will be installed 
# properly for you, you don't need to do that here.

# After being installed in debian/tmp, everything is chowned to root.root,
# and chmod g-ws is run on everyything. Enter below any chmod commands you
# need to run to set files to the proper permissions. This is where you
# can make programs be suid, etc.
# (Note that these commands will be run as root.)
