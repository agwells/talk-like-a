# talk-like-a

## 2.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Moved files into `dist` directory. In the unlikely event that someone was directly
  importing one of the files like `import {b1ff} from 'talk-like-a/src/b1ff';`,
  that would now break. So in an abundance of caution, I'm making this a major
  version bump.

### Patch Changes

- Including type definition files
